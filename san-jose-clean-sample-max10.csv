I have to say I'm a little confused about the negative reviews the EZ 8 motel has received from other users. It was by far the cheapest hotel in the area. We had previously only experienced motels through depictions on shows such as The Wire, The Sopranos and Bates Motel. From our limited experience, this resembled a motel. There was indeed a man hanging around the reception area who may have taken some crack, but he was no trouble at all. There was a Bentley in the car park, suggesting a level of affluence. Following the Sharks game we had a few ales at the local inn (the Doghouse). Following this we tried to go swimming in the pool. The security guard patiently explained to us that we couldn't go swimming as it was 3am and we were highly inebriated, and gave us an onion ring instead. He was polite but firm and made us feel safe. Even when someone jumped the fence to try and swim he kept his cool. In retrospect he had our best interests at heart. Going above and beyond his security guard duties. We slept through the night with no problems. The next day we went to Denny's, which was terrible (for the sake of brevity I won't go into that here), and then returned to the Doghouse to watch the first leg of the Sky Bet championship playoffs between Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton (a 2-0 victory for the Owls, with goals from Wallace and Lee). We realised when we returned to the car the we had inadvertently left two of the car doors wide open. Nothing was stolen, indicating that despite the recent murders alluded to in other reviews, the area is in fact exceptionally safe. (We did initially think that a phone charger may have been taken, but this was in fact at the bottom of a bag, and in any case had a retail value of 2.99).\n\nThoroughly recommended.\n",5,positive,"May 13, 2016",1550 N 1st St,"('San Jose',)",California,95112-4822

After letting the water run for ten minutes, we gave up.  Also, the drain was clogged, so the tub was over half full of water.  The next morning, the water remained, which I took a picture of.

I'm not a terribly fussy traveler but this room was horrible!  It stunk so bad like old cigarette smoke covered with a strong cleaner.  We were on a bottom floor room closest to the busy road and heard the train and traffic all night long.  The pillows and bed were old, old, old.  Seriously, they had dips in the middle and heavy, compressed material in the pillow.  The window did not lock.  The door locks were flimsy at best.  We stacked our suitcases and a chair in front as we did not feel safe.  The bathroom was clean but the water never heated up.  Only one of us took a (luke warm) shower.  It was a long, sleepless and memorable night.  Just not for good reasons.  We are now laughing hysterically when we talk about it.  Anyway, I would never stay here again!!",1,negative,"December 18, 2019",1310 N 1st St,"('San Jose',)",California,95112-4709

Breakfast is terrible, also nothing, I stayed 2 days there, when I walked in the morning, there are sweet bread there and it look right it was there for few weeks. When I asked the staff to confirm is this breakfast, you replied \""Thats it\"".",1,negative,"October 14, 2019",1310 N 1st St,"('San Jose',)",California,95112-4709

Checked in with a reservation - checked out and demanded refund after 2 hours. \n\nWhen we arrived I had to stand in the driveway while waiting in line. They had signs that the lobby was open but it was locked. There was no phone in the room, the television wasn't working (we did get that remedied), and when our dinner arrived and we sat down to eat, cockroaches climbed out of everywhere. \nThey were on my bed, behind the headboard, behind the mini-fridge, and on the walls.  My granddaughter is allergic to roaches and we immediately left the room. \nThey did give me a full refund, but I would not EVER recommend staying at this property. I have never left a place so fast. We were out of that room with all our belongings in less than 2 minutes. Fortunately we had not opened or unpacked our luggage!",1,negative,"April 21, 2022",1310 N 1st St,"('San Jose',)",California,95112-4709
