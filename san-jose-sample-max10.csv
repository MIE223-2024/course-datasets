I have to say I'm a little confused about the negative reviews the EZ 8 motel has received from other users. It was by far the cheapest hotel in the area. We had previously only experienced motels through depictions on shows such as The Wire, The Sopranos and Bates Motel. From our limited experience, this resembled a motel. There was indeed a man hanging around the reception area who may have taken some crack, but he was no trouble at all. There was a Bentley in the car park, suggesting a level of affluence. Following the Sharks game we had a few ales at the local inn (the Doghouse). Following this we tried to go swimming in the pool. The security guard patiently explained to us that we couldn't go swimming as it was 3am and we were highly inebriated, and gave us an onion ring instead. He was polite but firm and made us feel safe. Even when someone jumped the fence to try and swim he kept his cool. In retrospect he had our best interests at heart. Going above and beyond his security guard duties. We slept through the night with no problems. The next day we went to Denny's, which was terrible (for the sake of brevity I won't go into that here), and then returned to the Doghouse to watch the first leg of the Sky Bet championship playoffs between Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton (a 2-0 victory for the Owls, with goals from Wallace and Lee). We realised when we returned to the car the we had inadvertently left two of the car doors wide open. Nothing was stolen, indicating that despite the recent murders alluded to in other reviews, the area is in fact exceptionally safe. (We did initially think that a phone charger may have been taken, but this was in fact at the bottom of a bag, and in any case had a retail value of 2.99).\n\nThoroughly recommended.\n",5,positive,"May 13, 2016",1550 N 1st St,"('San Jose',)",California,95112-4822

It was heaven!\n\nThis wonderful little beach front resort is run by Elaine and Ed. They are the most wonderful couple and extremely hiker friendly. They let me stash a resupply bag there as my hiking trip started, the good people from the Sunshine Coast Shuttle dropped it off. My original plan was to hike into town where the Seebreeze is, stay in the campground, resupply then head out in the morning. I didn't plan on historic amounts of rainfall.\n\nThe Seebreeze is the closest lodgings to the Sunshine Coast Trail from the Dixon Road trailhead...about 10 minutes from the Store\u002FPizzeria. So if you are a hiker traveling by foot its perfect for you. Elaine was able to put me up in Condo 2 without having a reservation. She even turned the heat up and made coffee for me seeing how wet and cold I was. I slept so well that night I asked if I could stay another while I let the flooding on the trail recede a bit before going back out. Elaine said it was no problem!\n\nOver the course of my 2 night stay I was able to meet the horses and the very sweet dogs. The resort has a gorgeous private beach so I took a walk down there to do some birding. I got to do my laundry. And I checked out the campground...it has hookups and a covered common cooking\u002Fdining\u002Fmingling area. There is even a salmon stream running through the property. \n\nThe condo itself was pretty much the size of my apartment. It had a covered deck overlooking the water. There was a bedroom with a queen sized bed and a giant tub to soak in. It also had a full eat in kitchen and living room with cable, internet, TV...all the civilization you could want after more than a week on the trail. \n\nThere are bigger condos closer to the water too.  If you are a group of hikers doing the trail, you could rent one of these and each have a bed to sleep in for a very reasonable price. Considering the full kitchens and laundry on site you have everything you need for a night off the trail. \n\nAnd if you come with a car, there is a TON of stuff to do right in the area. Biking, sea kayaking, canoeing, rock climbing and other activities are a few miles away. Just make sure to take a dip at the resort beach and be back to catch a sunset over the water, Texada island lit up in the background. \n\nI can't say enough about how welcoming Elaine was.

Families especially - you just want a nice home base for your travels, decent location, good view, not too expensive. Not too fancy, but serviceable. Seabreeze seems to check all the boxes.\n\nBut there are real issues with this \""family-friendly\"" property - hidden fake fees!!! We booked a 2BR Apartment here for 3 nights on Booking.com - Apt 3A.\u00A0On arrival, we were charged a \""child fee\"" that the very unfriendly owner claimed was \""listed on both the Booking.com site, and the resort's own website\"".\n\n- We went back and looked at both sites after paying the\u00A0$25\u00A0\""per night, per child\"" fee. There was NO such fees listed on either site. \n- I do tons of research before I book anything, and these \""fees\"" were not mentioned anywhere. \n- Email confirmation of reservation from both Booking.com and Seabreeze - neither mention any additional fees. \n- I had called 2 weeks before our arrival and asked about kids stuff - no mention of any additional fees on that call.\n- Both Booking.com and the resort website said that there are pony rides available for children - in person, owner said this had been suspended over a year ago. False advertising! \n\nThis is preying on families - you show up with kids and are told there are extra fees? In this remote area? Where are you supposed to go? Reservations are made months advance. So families pay, and probably don't think anything of it - if they can afford it. Otherwise, \""$25\u00A0per night, per child\"" would add up pretty quickly - for a family of 5 staying 5 days, that's\u00A0$375! Plus tax! We refused and immediately asked for a refund. The owner pitched a world class fit, but eventually gave us the refund. In her ranting, owner made racist statements about ethnic groups including \""Chinese people showing up with 10 people\"" or people \""who think their teenagers are children - teenagers are adults, need to pay more fees\"". Made multiple claims about 2 BR apt rentals being \""double occupancy only, two people! with additional fees for all extra people\"" - whereas Booking.com clearly states \""Fits 4 people\"" with no extra fees, and no mention of \""double occupancy\"" on the Seabreeze site. Why would a couple need a two br apt? Told us we could go find another place to stay? No, we just won't pay fake fees.\u00A0We showed her every website page that did not mention these nonexistent fees. We got our refund. The owner never apologized, and was incredibly rude about it. \n\nBUYER BEWARE - Don't pay extra fees! What Booking.com says you are paying should be it, or Booking.com should remove these scammers from their site right now.\u00A0 Absolutely disgusting to bill your motel as family-friendly, only to ask for extra fees on arrival. Gauging families who just want to get away and relax is just plain wrong, and the owner should be ashamed of herself. She owes every family she has ever charged these fake fees an apology and a refund.\u00A0\n\nNitty gritty review: Apt was very clean, and had a nice view. But it was also very uncomfortable.\u00A0Decor is 70's thrift store grandma. Furniture\u00A0was old, broken, or both. Chair in living room had a footstool that leaned precariously sideways - not useful for resting your legs. Lots of complaints from my family about aching backs from bad mattresses. \""Fully stocked kitchen\"" had only a strange hodge podge of equipment, but lacked basic tools. Water pressure in shower was terrible - we all took one shower here only, then waited to next hotel. Huge hole in screen door. Beach can be nice - but very high tides here mean no beach access for half the day - this is not a hang out on the beach all day resort. There are laundry machines, but only two, so always a lineup.\n\nIf you booked on any site that did not mention these fees at the time of booking, don't pay them! Your reservation is a contract, you do not \""owe\"" any hidden fee you did not agree to and were never informed of.

The food was delicious, the drinks were amazing and the employees were very kind and helpful. The ocean was hot and the beach was beautiful. No rocks or seaweed. We were able to swim safely every day. \n\nWe took the tour to the Gamboa Rainforest. It was really worth it! \n\nCons: 1. the New Year\u2019s Eve party. There was a show with music, dancing and a host. Unfortunately, the only people allowed to attend were the guests with VIP (Plus?). There was a fence with security guards to let in only VIP guests. The rest of us were sent to a different section with chairs and tables plus a screen to watch what we were missing at the VIP party! It was totally ridiculous. Watching people dance and enjoy the live entertainment while we were outside the perimeter. Sometimes our screen froze. It was a shame because the employees worked so hard to make this evening special, the buffet was gorgeous, there were beautiful fireworks! It was a shame that they decided to make some kind of reserved section and divide the guests. Last year we spent New Year\u2019s at the Dominican Republic (Be Live Puerto Plata) and this did not happen at the resort we were staying, everyone was included at the party. \n\n2. Room key. I can\u2019t believe this hotel doesn\u2019t use electronic cards. All room keys are engraved with the room number so if you lose your key, like my husband did, there is a high risk of theft in your room!

During our four night stay, the hotel was perfectly quiet. The bed was comfortable. We were not awakened even once by external noises.  \n\nOur room was immaculately clean.  The maid came each day and had our room back in order before noon.\n\nWe stayed in room 636. It had all the amenities we want from a hotel room. It had a refrigerator, a safe, a large TV, plenty of drawer space, and two comfortable beds.\n\nThe bathroom had a separate tub, walk in shower, toilet area and sink. This is the largest functional bathroom area of any hotel room that we have seen.\n\nThe hotel is a green facility. It is off the electric grid, with all power generated from solar panels on the roof.\n\nThe front desk staff is very efficient, with check in taking about a minute and contactless express check out available. \n\nWhen we needed help with luggage, a staff person was available.  When we needed an item we forgot to bring from home, a staff member brought the item to our room quickly.\n\nThe hotel has a first class Japanese restaurant on the premises known as Ise Shima. It was open for three meal times. Room service is available. We visited for the breakfast buffet, which featured numerous healthy items for a traditional Japanese or American breakfast.  We had a perfect experience in the restaurant, too.\n\nFor the cost of the room, the entire experience is a great value.  One can obviously see the great pride the staff has in delivering a perfect hotel experience.\n\nThe hotel has free parking out front and security at the entrance. A guest cannot take the elevator above the first floor without a room key.\n\nThe Wi-Fi was free and easy to access. It worked well. A public computer is available on the first floor.

The hotel continues to function as an outstanding property, but the pandemic has forced some changes. please see my previous reviews for an overview of the property.\n\nThe most noticeable change to the hotel is the stepped up pandemic protocol. The management and staff are exercising great care to provide a safe, germ free environment.  The hotel appears to be immaculate. Hand sanitizer is abundantly available.\n\nSmall amenities, like restaurant menus, pens, paper etcetera, have been removed so that all of the surfaces are completely cleaned between guest visits. the amenities remain available by request thru the front desk.\n\nAnother change is that maid service has been made optional.  Some people do not want their room cleaned each night of their stay. We stayed three nights and opted for a daily cleaning. The maid did an excellent job each night. Best to express your preference at check in. \n\nWe slept extremely well in the comfortable bed and the bathroom configuration is the finest of any hotel we have stayed at. The hotel does an excellent job of providing a clean, comfortable room, its primary mission.\n\nSecurity appears to have been upgraded, with a full time guard stationed at the hallway entrance to the guest area evenings and overnight.  The hotel has security cameras in public areas.  The neighborhood around the hotel had no vagrants or unsavory characters when we walked it. One needs a card key to access guest floors via elevator.\n\nThe Mitsuwa shopping center next to the hotel has closed since our last visit. However, the shopping center 100 yards away at Carson and Western has excellent restaurants, a very good bakery, and a Daiso Japanese goods store.  \n\nThe hotel still has a restaurant with limited operations. Breakfast is take out only. Lunch and dinner are takeout and dine in with reservation.  The menu is also limited.  As the pandemic winds down, the full fine dining experience will resume. June 15 is the date the Governor predicted full reopening of all businesses.\n\nThe hotel gift shop has been converted to a self service center where the guest can buy snacks 24 hours rather than just during the limited hours the gift shop used to be opened.  The new center has fewer product choices, but at lower prices, plus the convenience of 24 hour access with a room key.\n\nWe found that the staff continues to do their work with optimal efficiency and professionalism. We were greeted upon each arrival and departure to and from the hotel. Check in and out took about a minute. We felt welcome and appreciated as guests.              \n\nThe outside grounds were well maintained, with the parking area free of litter and debris.  Valet and shuttle service have been suspended for the duration of the pandemic. However, we were offered assistance with our bags.\n\nThe one time we needed something, we asked the front desk and it was delivered in only 5 minutes.\n\nWe had no maintenance issues with our room.  Everything operated as it should. Nothing was out of order or in need of repair. \n\nBefore our departure, we started to plan our next visit.  When I read negative reviews about any business, I tend to be skeptical.  I wonder about what kind of a bad day or unreasonable expectation the reviewer must have had. This property is top notch. We have absolutely no complaints. Every visit is a joy, like coming home again.

Nice  touch  was  the welcome  drink  from the team on arrival\n\nI had  emailed  the hotel  many weeks  before  arrival  to ask for  a room on the 1st floor if possible,  re possible noise  from  rooms  above sadly no response, also Tui  had placed  this  request on my booking,  I was  dismayed to find  during  check in requests  had not  been actioned,  until  Paulao  (sorry if spelt incorrectly), managed to find  a room on first floor,  great  customer  service  from  her\n\nFound the room eventually ( on signs named as villas  which threw me),  was amazed how spacious  they are (pictures  onTA do not show this), two large beds,  side cabinets  (us brits love these for our undies), large set of drawers, ample space  in wardrobe,  safe  (free),  fridge  and optics,  bathroom quite large  two sinks,  storage underneath fab, seperate loo, large ceilng fan and  AC,  (which was much neeed and worked  great), smallish  balcony, only thing  I would say is  ALL the  furniture is dated  looks it,  maybe  an update  is needed\n\nWandered round on first  day  to find  shop, restaurants  etc  so  here is my review\n\nFood\u002FDrink -  we  ate  in the main  restaurant for  breakfast  and evening meals,  fantastic  air conditioning,  the  choices  are  amazing,  cater  for  many nationalities,  I usually only eat  one meal  a day at home, but was having  two  breakfasts,  dinners  and evening  meals,  not because  I am  a typical Brit  (I've paid for it  so I am having it kinda gal), simply  because of the  variatey whilst I am away, I always  eat more plus I like to try other food types not just  Brit food,  the waiting staff are so  busy at  every  sitting,  a credit  to this hotel.  we also  ate  at the open air  restaurant at lunch  (behind the swim up pool), this is cooked fresh on  an outside  barbecue area, whilst   limited  choices  which  was fine,  was  very filling  and  tasty,  only  complaint  is where you sit  is open plan so birds  fly in and out basically eyeing your food up,  maybe  some form of netting  could  be placed  either side, which may prevent them  getting in.  We  also  ate  at the  italian,  food was  cooked fresh,  fantastic meal, did  not  get  chance to eat at the steakhouse  as always  a queue, did not  try the chinese restaurant either.   There is  a restaurant on the  beach,  lunchtime  food  is  fab,  but we used this more  for  the drinks  due to heat,  this  restaurant  doubles up on an   evening  as  a mexican  restaurant,  we did not  try.  We  used the  swim up pool for  drinks, lived on  a shot  called a Scooby Doo,  lush\u002Fstrong,  on an evening  we also used  the 24hr sports bar,  air conditoned, the  staff in there again  a credit to the hotel,  they make  any  cocktails that are  not on the list,  this  can be noisey at times\n\nPool Areas -  These  have plenty of  sun beds  and shade,  sadly  the usual bed hoggers with towels were in action,  this is NOT  needed  as there are plenty around ALL pools all day,  this is the only holiday  where  the  swimming pools  feel like you are swimming in a hot  bath,  not  very refreshing  at all,  I used  the showers on the side  to cool down,  not sure  management  can  do anything  about this,  we  mainly  sat  around  the  swim up bar  when not at the  beach.   There are smoking  areas  around the hotel, outside  reception,  areas  as you walk  to your rooms\u002Fpools\n\nBeach  -  You  can  wait outside  the hotel  for  a lovely guy  who drives a golf  cart  (extra  seating),  which  drives  you to the  beach through a shaded passageway,  we opted  to walk  re  having eaten large  breakfast,  the  beach  area  is amazing,  colours of  the  sea,  sand lovely and soft,  plenty of sund beds, in the times  we  used  the  beach  there were always ample  empty  beds.   There are  two  other RIU's either side of the Tequila's  area,  Yucatan  and Playa, you can  go into  both hotels  and  their   beach areas,  usual  beach activities,  jet skis,  para gliding, etc  only  negatives  are  the  sellars trying to sell hats, jewellary  etc,  became annoying  after some  time but  eventually they  took the  hint,  not  as much  seaweed  as I expected, was found on entry to the  sea,  (which  was warm to enter),   there are guys  on tractors  who   do the their  best  to keep clear, kept having to pinch myself  re I was sat in the Carribean  just  breath taking\n\nEntertainment  -  This was hit and miss for me,  there is a useful  electric notice board  in reception that you can click on that  tells you  what  is planned for  each day,  from 10.00am  upto  11.00pm.  Best nights for me  were  the  Neon  and White night also the silent disco,  the animation team  are in reception before  the  shows  begin,  guest can have  faces painted,   there is also  a  back  drop for  picture opportunities, we  had brought our own  glow  sticks  etc  for the neon night,  was  fantastic,  as  was  the white night.  The  silent  disco  was  strange  and entertaining,  you choose  via  a switch on the head  sets which  dj sets you  want to listen to,  it is funny when no music  is heard    in the  large open aired  entertainment area, when head sets  are taken off ,  plus  you can hear  the  many  out of tune  wannabee Beyonce singers including me and my  son.  There is also  a nightclub 'Pasha', stays open until  2,  we did not use  this  as  after  being in the sun,  eating, drinking  and the night time  heat  we  were too tired.  On the Neon\u002FWhite night, you will find  quests  are bussed in from  other Riu hotels,  this made the hotel  very busy\u002Fnoisey,  extra  drinking  stations  were set up, \nalso  which I found was needed,  if you were going for  food  before  the  shows on these nights  your  armband  was  checked to ensure  you  were Tequila  guests\n\nAlso  around  the grounds  are  various  animals,  signs  clearly say DO NOT FEED,  as usual  idiots  given  them  bread,  sweets,  etc,  these are wild animals,  we  went on a trip  one am,  we  were up  at  5,  whilst walking to reception  we  saw  a few  monkeys  and  their  young was  great  to see\n\nPositives  -  The  Staff,  these  are the  heart and soul of this hotel,  from the gardeners,  cleaning team,  food\u002Fbar staff,  animation  team,  always  pleasant,  do a  fantastic  job,  especially working  in such  heat,  even the  staff were struggling  who were outside not in the luxury of  AC.  Rooms cleaned to a high  standard, never  had to ask  for  drinks  etc  to be topped up.  The  chef's\u002Fwaiting staff,  work  tirelessly  throughout the  day to feed and look after guests.  The hotel  is  very  spacious,  whilst  we were there (through a quiz)  we found  around 1,500  were  staying,  did not feel cramped  at all.\n\nNegatives  -  Pool areas,  the umbrella's   do not  give much shade, perhaps  could  do with being  stronger  material and  darker  colour,  the beds  that are under the cabana's,  some of the cabana's  covers  are  broken,  the cords do not pull them  across,  also  many  are  ripped,  this is  a 5* hotel, this should be looked into\n\nThere are NO  umbrella's on the beach,  there are  palm trees which do not give much shade,  you also have  to move your  bed as the sun moves,  we were always  lucky to be in shade  under  a large  tree which is  near the  restaurant,  so you could have  a bed in the shade  and in the sun\n\nPool  Swim up bar  -  The music  here  was usually in spanish and sometimes too loud,  they seem to forget  the majority of  guests  are  Europeans\u002FAmericans, maybe  change  this throughout  the  day\n\nEntertainment  -  Again mainly  aimed  at Spanish speakers,  the compere  when  he did speak in English  was  way  too fast,  some of the  shows  are  not  entertaining.  The  team  do  a great job,  however  whilst  I appreciate  these  shows  are repeated  every  two  weeks,  you could  tell they  were  going  through  the motions especially in some of the  dance  routines,  which spoilt  the  show\n\nAs mentioned  previously  furniture  in the  rooms could  do with being upgraded,  plus  there is  a large tv on the wall,  could only  find  two channels  with English speaking films,  maybe  widen choice,  great to lay on your  bed  with an English cuppa tea  (brought my own  kettle),  eating chocolate and crisps  after  a long  day in the sun,  then have your  much  needed  siesta \n\nTo  finish,  we did enjoy  our time  here,  AMAZING staff,  where  the hotel is situated,  total  value  for money,  felt strange not  having to pay  for food\u002Fdrinks etc,  we did however  tip the staff who had provided  great service,  our cleaner Luisa,  the  two  members of the team in the  sports  bar who always  had  a smile  ( I am  terrible  at  names),  if the mangement  could just  take  the time to  action  issues  I  and others  have  raised  previoulsy and many times  onTA  this hotel  would  be  elevated, hopefully if the management team  respond to my  review  it will not  be  the bog  standard   response,  actions  speak louder than words,  we  are looking  to  return,  in \""cooler\"" weather,  hopefully  October\u002FSeptember 2024,  where  we may see improvements in areas detailed\n\n MUCHAS GRACIAS\n\nALL Tequila  staff  -  You  are  ALL   STARS\n\nJulie and Jay",5,positive,"July 23, 2023",Avenida Xaman-ha Manzana 3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77710

data_sj/ca/189541/1986559/920942686.html,AC Hotel by Marriott Bella Sky Copenhagen,"""We stayed here for 4 nights in September 2023 exploring Copenhagen.\n\nThe location is really good and the city center is easy to reach by subway (5 mins walk to the station and then 5 stops) which rides every couple of minutes 24\u002F7. Also the nearby little park\u002Fforest offers great opportunities for a morning jog. The area in general is still under development so restaurants, supermarkets are there but still in limited quantity. The nearby Shoppingcenter Fields has all the shops you\u2018ll find in any big city and is not a very special destination. But on a rainy day, you can spend some time here.\n\nBreakfast buffet in the morning is very busy but also very good and the food provided is fresh, offers a vide variety and of good quality. We usually don\u2018t like hotel buffets but this one is really good.\n\nOur room was on the 22nd floor towards the city of Copenhagen. That offers indeed a nice view, however, since rooms are small and the seating options are limited, we really didn\u2018t make too much use of it (i.e. getting food from the bar at night and dining in-room is really not possible). Room and bathroom was very clean but shows already some ageing. The sink didn\u2018t work properly and lighting in part was broken and both remained unfixed even upon request. \n\nOverall service impression was very much average. Reception was not very knowledgeable and also when asked about parking, ev-charging (see below)  and public transportation, the hectically handed out a brochure but didn\u2018t explain (\u201Ewe\u2018re a normal hotel and don\u2018t do concierge services\u201C - hmmm\u2026). Also: on the first night we tried the bar for a drink and some little food: service really didn\u2019t care much about us. I really missed being welcomed.\n\nAnd now to parking and in particular to ev-car-parking:\nAround the hotel is sufficient room for parking. BUT these lots are not operated by the hotel and you need to have a parking app like easypark or APCOA to,pay your fees. But please note that fees (and in particular: service fees on top of parking fees) differ hugely between the apps. The hotel recommended \u201Aeasy park\u2018. But this appears to be the most expensive option. I finally settled for APCOA - but you should make your own research.\n\nEV Parking: driving a full electric vehicle, I\u2018ll not return to this place. On their website they mention that charging is possible. This is actually not wrong BUT there are 2 high-speed-charging spots reserved for taxis, 4 charging spots reserved for hotel-\u002Fpropertymanagement cars and 4 (four) slow chargers for all others. Around these 4 \u201Ageneral public\u2018 chargers typically 8-10 car-sharing cars are parked (and regularly exchanged by the car-sharing company) so that I didn\u2018t have a single chance to charge my car in 4 days. This way, the hotel is not ready for the future.\n\nIn summary: it\u2018s a good alternative when visiting Copenhagen and if you don\u2018t want to stay downtown. The hotel is, although it has a fancy architecture, nothing special but clean and comfortable. Service needs improvement as does parking and EV charging.",3,negative,"October 12, 2023",Center Boulevard 5,"('',)",Zealand,2300

I recommend doing the same if you plan on returning since you can reserve a specific one. \n\nEveryone I\u2019ve come in contact with at Blackwoods, employee or guest, has been respectful and friendly.

Let\u2019s do this one in categories.\n\nSERVICE\nReally nice staff and helpful too. I arrived early on the day and they let me into my room 3 hours before check-in time without extra cost which was much appreciated :) Thank you!\n\nROOM\nSo I definately stayed in better hotels before. Let\u2019s ubderline this hotel wasnt my first Choice but my holiday provider changed it a week before my holiday.\nRoom was spacious enough for myself. What I noticed first was toilet on its own in a small cubicle - without a sink to wash your hands.\nThere is a sort of wardrobe space but it is definately not big enough. Coffee and tea station on weirdly high shelf which is unusual. Big TV with few English channels but don\u2019t expect to much. Even there are English movie channels most of them will be in French and if you happen to catch English one it will be a very weird one to the point you\u2019d rather watch news. I sticked to Netflix on my phone.\nBed was big but there was something wrong with matress that was causing back pain as soon as I lied down.\nNext to bed was a small couch which was quite comfy.\nOn the other side of bed cute double wooden door that will lead you to bath, shower and sink!\nSo you go to the toilet, do your business, then you have to go across the room not touching anything with your hands to get through wooden door to wash your hands?! Weird, I know. \nHotel is definately outdated and needs some investment. If you charge 120-150 euro per night surely there is some money to get few things done like - normal tap or toilet with a sink, new carpets and furniture.\n\nIn General it was clean but when I started looking there are some details that were missed by cleaners like massive splash on elevator door, smudge on desk in the room a d others. \n\nMy room was cleaned every day by housekeeping. They did basics: bed, take away rubbish, clean the cups, clean the sink and hoovering.\n\nRESTAURANT\nSo you wont get much to eat in France as hardly any restaurant is open between 1 and 7 PM - for someone like me who gets hungry about 4-5 it was most inconvenienct. Next time before I travel I guess I\u2019ll have to check restaurants opening times first. \nThat included restaurant in the hotel. I havent used it. Not even for breakfast. As a person who eats toast with Jam in the morning I could not spend 19,50 euro per breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Definately too much.\n\nAREA\nSo it is a bit rough. Next to hotel there are 2 open building sites. You should t hear it in the hotel though due to double windows. It does take about 10 minutes of brisk walk to old town and about 25-30 to the Sea. There is Lidl just round the corner. Its not the biggest but it covers the basics.\n\nNice alrogether is beautiful. There is a lot to see. I recommend taking a train to see other towns like Cannes, Antibes, Eze or Monte-Carlo.

The 45 minute jeep tour of the estate was a highlight of our stay - Carlos was charming and extremely knowledgeable.  But do make sure to book ahead for the jeep tour!\n\nThe 29 rooms are spread across a wide area and offer a range of options. We had booked a simple double room, which was very compact, but was fine. There are plenty of outdoor seating areas in front of the room and in other parts of estate. Even when full, the quinta never felt busy.\n\nWe ate in the Cantina every night (four nights) and the menu was adequate - but had we been staying longer, it would not have offered enough options.\nThe team were friendly and their recommendations for wine were excellent.  In terms of value for money the prices for the food and wine were very good, as were the prices in the quinta's shop.\n\nThe restaurant team were friendly - in particular Areta who was so professional and completely charming.\n\nWe had a wonderful stay.  Were they any downsides? There were three things we noted, which we felt could have been better: \n(1) breakfast was stressful. The team\u002Fkitchen didn't seem to be able to time the hot food so that it arrived at the right time for us - so we adopted a strategy of only ordering the our food once we'd finished our fruit\u002Fyoghut etc. Despite the quinta producing its own honey, this was only served at breakfast on request. They also served cake and cinnamon croissants automatically, which we noted many people didn't eat - this seemed very wasteful and contributed to the second problem ...\n(2) the terrace was plagued by wasps, which several diners found distressing\u002Fannoying. We feel that the restaurant team should invest in some proper wasp traps to hang in the trees along the front of the terrace to try reduce the impact on guests.\n(3) There are speakers in the gardens, among the shrubs, which play piped music - we felt that this was unnecessary and spoilt the peace (and birdsong) of the quinta. It was particularly annoying during breakfast.  And it was even more annoying when, on 13 October, the playlist began to include Christmas songs.\n\nFinally, an observation - it's NOT a place for anyone with limited mobility; there are steep walks between the rooms and facilities, the surfaces are often very uneven and the lighting at night means navigating the steps can be tricky.\n\nWould we recommend Ventozelo? Yes, definitely. \n\n",5,positive,"October 15, 2023",Quinta de Ventozelo,"('Ervedosa do Douro',)",Northern Portugal,5130-057

Restaurant\u002Flunch\u002Fcoffee onsite.\n\nUnfortunately I could not check in upon arrival around 12.30 coming from Hong Kong (there was no pre-check in option where you can indicate at what time you are arriving)\nSo I left my bags and went for a stroll for a few hours.\n\nWhen I returned the receptionist told me I was upgraded to a large room. I specifically booked the medium room with terrace so my question was if the large room had a terrace as well. It had a small balcony but no furniture. So I told her I wanted the room with the terrace hence I specifically booked this room in advance. This terrace room s a specific option at the hotel.\nWhen I told her I wanted my booked room, it turned out there was an issue with that room so it was not available. Not sure what the issue was but I found it odd they did not realize that people book this room specifically for the terrace. Instead she tried to get around it and tell me I got an upgrade. It felt not honest to me, I am a platinum member at the Accor group so clearly travel often so I feel she could have just told me there was an issue, apologies, so they would offer me another room which is almost similar blah blahblah\n\nAnyway, she showed me the room, it had a very small terrace and you could pull a chair outside and enjoy a morning coffee on the 7th floor in the sunshine. Since I was tired after a long trip and wanted a shower, I took the room.\nThe receptionist told me she would go downstairs to collect my bags: that took at least 15min which meant I still could not get into the shower.\n\nIn the meantime I found at least 10 long hairs stuck to the wall in the bathroom next to the toilet so I mentioned this when she came back with my suitcases and she promised they would clean it after I showered.\n\nWhen I came back from my walk after the shower, the hairs were still there but the garbage bin had been emptied.....and the hairs were not hard to miss as they were long and there were a lot.\n\nSo I went for dinner and asked again to clean the wall which they promised would happen...guess what, after dinner the hairs were still there.\nThe receptionist also offered 'free drinks' to make up for the hairs but since I am a gold member I always get a free drink which she did not give me during my check-in. So no free member drink but 'free' hairs in the bathroom drink.\n\nFunnily enough when we were in the bar later that evening, we had to pay for one of the drinks as that was not on the 'free' drink menu. I have to say, the receptionist removed that one from my bill the next day.\n\nThe rooms are pretty nice, they have a nice view over Lisbon, large room as a separate sofa area which gives you a bit more space. Design is nice and colourful, room had floor to ceiling windows all along the wall.\n\nRooftop bar was closed and you could not even go up there for a picture as the doors were all locked.\n\nI think the hotel was quite ok if they get cleaning under control.\n\nI had dinner in the hotel and that was pretty good as well although restaurant 'only' opened at 7pm and I was on a jetlag so there at 6....could still have a glass of wine there. Bit of a shame they did not have some snacks to go with the drinks\nBreakfast next day was in the same restaurant: it had a good spread of food so that was quiet enjoyable. Cool plates and cups by the way, as mentioned, the vibe is pretty good.\n\nI would probably return as it had a good location, I like the design and it was very affordable.",3,negative,"November 18, 2023",Rua do Vale de Pereiro 19,"('Lisbon',)",Central Portugal,1250-270

It\u2019s nice to have that kid of welcome when we\u2019ve been travelling around Europe for a month before checking into mama\u2019s and found most of the staff behind the reception of European hotels to be grumpy looking, never smile and not helpful whatsoever. This was our first mama experience. I found the hotel to be sub standard. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms don\u2019t have any kettles, coffee\u002Ftea making facilities or a decent size desk to work on. Every room has a small round table and a stool. The slightly bigger rooms have a 3\u002F4 seater couch like armchairs. I personally think it would be better if they replaced it with a workbench as stated in mama\u2019s site (business desk) otherwise absolutely no where to do some work as there wasn\u2019t anywhere in the reception area to work. The pillows are so uncomfortable. No neck support. \nMama shelter got so many cannots. When we went to claim our welcome drinks on the 31st afternoon we were told we can\u2019t claim cos they\u2019re too busy preparing for the NYE dining. I was not told that the drinks can\u2019t be claimed on that day when I was given the vouchers at check in. I personally think the staff at the restaurant counter were just lazy. There was 3 standing there talking while one was serving. It doesn\u2019t take much to just grab some soft drinks and give them to the guests. The next day I went back to claim, now I\u2019m told I can\u2019t take the bottles upstairs to our rooms. I asked why coz other Accor hotels allow. I was told even though this is apart of Accor, it was mama\u2019s policy no glass bottles allowed to be taken to the rooms. Yet our welcome amenities were 2 glass bottle waters with 2 glasses and a welcome platter with tasty treats but the apple on the platter was all bruised. No attention to quality here. I did end up getting the drinks to take to the room after speaking to a gentleman behind the check in counter. He was helpful and went to the bar with me. Kelly from the bar very helpful taking the drinks up to the room with me. As we had 4 rooms we claimed the drinks on 2 separate occasions. Manuel was very helpful with claiming our last drinks the night before our departure. No issues here about glass bottles so I don\u2019t know what the problem was with the other guy. I should have gotten his name. \nLocation wise it\u2019s ok. A little far to walk to the centre. Approx half hr walk to R Augusta city centre. There is a mini prego (mini mart) just a couple of doors down and a Maccas across the road 2 mins walk. Also a few small places very close by for breakfast.

Inside, the ceilings are high, the rooms tastefully and meticulously decorated, and the atmosphere filled with such pleasing scents and sounds that made us feel warmly welcomed our entire stay. That and the fact that our hosts greeted us at the door with two jars of homemade \u201CRoom Cookies\u201D and gave us a tour, pointing out the original features of the house and where to find everything.  I stayed in the gorgeous Cinderella room and my children stayed in the Enchanted Forest. They played for hours with all the stuffies and puppets. I loved my room, however, was particularly drawn to the sunroom\u002Flibrary where I curled up with a book and lost myself in the quiet. We stayed during the off season and no other guests were staying the same weekend; we had the communal kitchen and bathroom to ourselves. We basically took them over, which made it feel even more like home. Breakfast was on a league of its own. The variety and quality of food was nothing I had ever experienced at a B&B and was different each morning. We were served pancakes and waffles with berries, freshly made cinnamon buns and carrot cake, hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs and bacon, fresh strawberries, chocolate covered strawberries, whipping cream, chocolate and caramel sauce, two types of juice, every kind of cereal you can imagine and more.
