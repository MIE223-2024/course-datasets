There\u2019s a main building, with the lobby, bar, buffet, and the largest portion of rooms, plus two other, smaller buildings with only rooms (these are all superior deluxe). The latter are very close to the beach.\nThe reception staff is very helpful and accommodating. We dealt mostly with Ann-Marie, and she promptly responded to all our queries and whatever issues we had (not many).\nThe superior deluxe room is spacious, with a walk-in shower, a jacuzzi bath and a separate toilet. The living area, except the bed, contains a sofa, a table with two chairs, a chest of drawers, a wardrobe and a fridge mini bar, plus the optics. We found our room absolutely sufficient. The balcony was nice, too.\nThe hotel beach is excellent. We can say that it\u2019s one of the best beaches in Punta Cana, and we\u2019ve seen a few: Uverto Alto (Grand Sirenis, Breathless) and Playa Bavaro (Lopesan), and Arena Gorda (Riu Republica). This stretch of the beach is between Arena Gorda and Playa Bavaro and is EXCELLENT! Wide, long, with very fine, almost white sand. The sea, however, is rough. Also, there was quite a lot of algae, both on the beach and in the sea. Whereas it\u2019s nature and the hotel can\u2019t do much about it, we\u2019d like to point out that the hotel should be responsible for cleaning the beach. It\u2019s unacceptable to have loads and loads of algae all around the loungers. The beach staff should be working on it since the dawn every day.\nApart from the buffet (serving breakfast and dinner), there is the luncheon restaurant, close to the beach and the pools. For dinner, you can choose from four a la carte restaurants: Japanese, Italian, French, and steakhouse. We never went to the Japanese one, but we found the rest very good, especially French (Krystal) and steakhouse, where they also serve lobster. The food was good. Not Michelin-good, but good.\nThe service throughout our stay was above average. As long as you\u2019re nice to the staff, they\u2019re nice back to you. We didn\u2019t have any issues, except the language barrier. It\u2019s really a shame that Dominicans don\u2019t want to learn English. It would so much easier for everybody!\nRiu Palace Macao will be closed between April 2023 and October 2023, as it is to undergo total renovation (a bit overdue).

They are friendly, remember you from year to year, and are genuinely happy to see you and serve you. It is not dependent on the size of the tip you pass on, or not, it is how friendly and polite you are to them!\nWe always tip small as we go and then deliver a well deserved tip to those that have stood out to us, at the end of our holiday.\nThe rooms are lovely after the refurbishment. Other customers have been complaining of damp but you have to realise that you are in a humid setting and so air circulation is of utmost importance. We were in the main building. We left the air con on while we were not in the room (it stays on even if you have not put your key card in the slot), and then opened the balcony doors when we returned to the room at the end of the day to let air in. Same in the evening and we slept with the balcony door slightly open to let in fresh air and breeze. We had no damp or mould problems whatsoever.\nWe initially had a problem with our room. Having booked from the UK we did not have the new descriptions of the rooms and so we did not have a double \u002F king bed, but two separate beds. I spoke to Charles at reception, quietly and politely, and he organised a room change two days later (they were very busy). Our new room had a king bed. He did laugh and say that most wives would be happy at having separate beds - LOL. I have noticed that if you instantly go \""on the attack\"" with front desk you do not necessarily get the best outcome. The front desk are slightly sterner than the remainder of the staff (with exception of Charles) and could do with some more training on how to handle difficult situations, but being front of house I should imagine they have to deal with all sorts so I can understand their defenses being up at times. (I heard an example of \""all sorts\"" when at reception!).\n\nNow to the remainder.... (in my opinion)\nRestaurants: Steakhouse - wonderful - Fillet Steak and Lobster were amazing. Chicken salad starter was disappointing but crab cakes were lovely. Chocolate cake dessert was excellent. Italian - very good - Starter buffet was good, Lamb cutlets were lovely. Krystals - very good - used to be the place to go for the steak, but this was not as good as the steakhouse this year. The Prawn salad starter was delicious and the fish main dish was superb. Across all restaurants the desserts were a bit disappointing, but you can always go to the buffet to pick your own selection of desserts, after your meal.\nBuffet: Breakfast - there is definitely something for EVERYONE and all good quality. The omelette's are cooked fresh, there is a good selection of cereals, smoothies, yoghurts, fruit, continental meats, cheeses, breads, muffins, pastries, croissants.... eggs fried, over easy, scrambled, boiled... bacon, sausages, tomatoes, baked beans, hash browns and then there;s the pancakes, donuts... \nEvenings - ALL the food we have eaten over the past eleven years has been great. A couple of dishes were not what we were expecting, but you can try and if you do not like, you can go pick something else. The carvery meats are delicious - chicken, gammon, beef...\nBars & Drinks: ALL good. If you don't see what you like, ASK...\nBEWARE of drinking too many cocktails - it will upset your stomach, which a lot of guests report as an illness or food poisoning, but is just not true!\nPools: One relaxing, one used for water aerobics and then relaxing and one swim up - which is the party pool as the day wears on.\nI have seen customers complaining about the noise from this pool - if you don't like it, don't sit near it would be my recommendation. We sit on the beach between the pool and the main public beach, which gives us access to the pools when we want it but we are far enough away to not be bothered by any \""party\"" noise. Guests are entitled to enjoy themselves and if the party pool is your enjoyment, then go ahead I say. You also get a breeze from the sea by sitting on the sand.\nStaff: excellent, genuine, happy, caring.... I cannot find enough adjectives to describe them in a deserving way. They absolutely make this hotel and deserve a whole heap of praise.\nThis hotel is busier. It has added more rooms. There are more beds around the pools to accommodate the growth. We were worried that it would feel too busy but the addition of Pepe's lunch bar and the Sports bar, along with the replacement of the indoor theatre with outside space for day time and evening seating and entertainment, seems to have spread everyone out enough. We never failed to get a seat by day or night. The main bar was also less busy as it is now enclosed and air conditioned.\nThe Elite bar (we were not Elite but you can see this in the reception area), never seemed to have more than 5 persons in it, mostly one or two, so we commented that perhaps this would be better utilised as a shop, similar to that in the Palace Bavaro next door, to be able to buy toiletries, cigarettes and mementos, rather than having to walk to the next hotel.\nSpecial mentions: Charles - Reception. Danny - main bar. Pedro (our family) - pool and beach area. Diomedes, Leonarda, Matteo, Santos. Francias and Palenco - all restaurant \u002F buffet, Smarlin and Jose at the pool bar.

I'm a huge RIU fan so had to try out the newly remodeled resort and was not disappointed. I have never stayed the same place twice but have been to both the RIU Palace Punta Cana and Bamboo just down the beach so I know the area and the beaches! The employees at this hotel are remarkable. I can't say one negative thing about them! I rely on other travelers opinions so here is mine! \n\nWe arrived on a Saturday afternoon. Got ready and went to the Neon party. We got our faces painted, got drinks and had a good time. We wore neon dresses but people also wore swimsuits as there are pools there. Either works. It was loud but still fun. We dressed for each day but didn't head over to the parties the rest of the week.\n\nThe rooms are very clean and always had a great stock of towels. Very nicely remodeled & beds were super comfy! We were on 3rd floor so got enough steps in each day! No complains about walk-in shower ... always had hot water! Having to put a keycard in to run electricity was kind of a pain but you get used to it. Phones, etc, won't charge overnight without it! Please remember to tip your housekeeping\u002Fservers\u002Fwait staff. They deserve it. We also brought 2 bags of DampRid and was glad we did! Crazy how much water was collected!\n\nEvery morning we ate at the buffet and if you can't find anything you like, then you're too picky! Our waiters ... Dagoberto & Wilman were our favorites and always had a smile! We appreciated their daily hugs & conversation! We ate a couple times at the buffet for lunch but preferred a quick, lighter lunch at Pepe's Food ... loved their chicken strips with chips & guac! \n\nWe ate 1 night at the buffet, otherwise ate at the other restaurants with the Steakhouse (2 nights) and Krystal (2 nights) being our favorites! You can't go wrong with the fillet & shrimp (done perfectly) at the Steakhouse and I had the Robalo fish at Krystal ... SO good & not fishy tasting! Don't order the steak at Krystal (tough). It got sent back and ordered the short ribs instead which were amazing ... they just fell apart! We thought both the Italian and Japanese were good. We always found something good to eat!\n\nI'm one who likes to workout in the mornings at the resort and enjoyed the fitness center. Very clean and good selection of free-weights, weight machines and cardio machines. Note that the free weights are measured in kg ... not lbs. I just thought I was tired from traveling but nope ... got that figured out pretty quick!\n\nAs like every other vacation, before heading for workouts I'd head down to the beach with our towels and get our spots ready for the day. I did that the 1st morning and that was it. There are plenty of chairs and spots to pick both in the sun and shade! And we had no issues when we were done at the beach to go to the swim-up bar and find chairs! \n\nWe were a little nervous about the weather as it showed rain every day. Don't even pay attention to that. We had 1 day of rain and a few quick showers and that was it. The day it did rain we spent by the swim-up bar just playing card games I brought along. If you want to find the most genuine person with a fabulous smile and who makes great drinks, find Bermudez in the swim-up bar. He is awesome!!! On our rainy day we \""drank the rainbow\"" throughout the day. Red\u002Forange\u002Fyellow\u002Fgreen\u002Fblue\u002Fpurple drinks & Bermudez made them all. So yummy & fun to see what he'd bring us next. Some of our favorite drinks during the week were espresso martini with Baileys & a chocolate martini with Baileys, but be careful! ;) We did enjoy The Cubano bar with Danny making drinks! Entertainment was good on the nights they had it! Great music and dancing shows. And then there was a singer and dancing afterwards. Entertainment staff member, George, always lit up the dance floor and kept us entertained all week!\n\nWe did do 1 excursion called \""Wild on Punta Cana Super Combo\"" which was OK. It was fun to get out and see the country! Swimming in the cenote was beautiful and the catamaran ride with open bar to the sand bar was fun. And we enjoyed a great lunch.\n\nAll in all this was a great place to vacation! Adults only was a bonus! I have and love kids ... but not having them on vacation was relaxing.

I have stayed at the RIU Palace in Aruba and thought we would be fine staying here. I was wrong. Upon arrival at the resort we were told that we were \""upgraded\"" to the other neighbor RIU resort. We explained to them that we chose this resort for the adults only option and for the many great reviews we have read. They continued to try and sell us on the other resort. We declined. After some hesitation they gave us room keys to our first room. We had booked an ocean front and we were given a small room with a balcony with a large white wall directly in front of it where we could only see the sky. Seriously. The room had a very strong smell of bug spray also. We were both very upset. My fianc\u00E9 had gone back to the front desk where they told him they were overbooked and could not give us a new room for a few days. He told them this was unacceptable and they said they could not get us another room until the next day. We were ready to leave on day 1 of 10.  The next day we were given the room we booked which was much better. The room was nice and had a large shower and nice balcony.\n      The best part of the vacation was the beach. We normally go back and forth from the pool to beach. Unfortunately we were not fans of the pools. There was a swim up bar with a pool that we did not go to because there were way too many people in there and they seemed to never get out to use the restrooms. Sorry but thats gross.  We were mainly in the pool next to it but we were yelled at for having drinks on the side of the pool. Apparently you can't have drinks in the other pools?

There is an interlock pathway (approx. 150 feet from the ocean) connecting the 4 beachfront RIU hotels (Palace Punta Cana, Bambu, Palace Macao & Palace Bavaro). The location of the Riu Palace Macao is ideal for beach walkers. You can walk either way (East\u002FWest) for very long distances. The guests were mostly from USA, Canada & Europe. This hotel is quiet, no loud music\u002Fnoise at night. This time the average age of the guests was approx. 55+ years. The hard working hotel personnel are ALL wonderful, friendly & give you an excellent service with a smile from your check-in (Ana Maria for us) to your check-out. My spouse and I will definitely return to the RIU Palace Macao resort as we had another very relaxing vacation at this small Adult only resort.  This resort is closing 5 months for a full renovation. So I will not elaborate more as many things will change\u002F be renovated.\n\nThis resort will not be available from April 10th to September 2023 as they are fully renovating the resort. We saw sneak pictures and were told (by resort employees and vacationers) that the resort will improve by creating a Sports bar with pool table. The Renova Spa at the Riu Palace Bavaro (next door) is moving (new building) across the street from the Macao\u2019s main lobby (near the tennis courts). The reception area is being modernized with lighter colours. The lunch buffet will move to the main buffet area. The food items should be relocated\u002F concentrated together. The rooms should be renovated with nice light colours, coco (light beige\u002Fbrown), white and a touch of light green. They expect to perform all these renovations in 5 months by having the crews work 24 hrs. Wow, it will be beautiful and we cannot wait to return later this year\u2026\n",5,positive,"April 15, 2023",Avenida Estados Unidos Playa Arena Gorda,"('',)",La Altagracia Province,23302

If your looking for an adults only hotel with a large private beach with lots of shady spots from natural palm trees then this is your place. Many of the resorts have a huge pool but smaller beach or with chairs on stop of each other.

The cuisine is a mix of European and Dominican influence of course they have basics like pizza and burger but if your looking for American food then go to Hard Rock. If you enjoy trying new foods then you should not be disappointed.\n\nThe rooms are needing an update especially the basic rooms, if you can afford it look to upgrade to a junior suite superior which will get you a better room near the beach.

The pool is stunning and always shaded areas.\n\nThe food in main buffet was lovely, a lot of choice   and even being quite fussy I still found plenty.\n\nBeing adults only, it can get quite rowdy at night time but in all honesty you couldn't hear it too much from your room.\n\nBeware of the shops on Caribbean Street...we got stung 100$ for 6 items in the mini market - avoid at all costs! Stickers on things but not one price so please please beware.\n\nThe cocktails are lovely, especially the Costa Caribe ( I sit here drinking one while waiting for pick up to airport!)\n\nI hope this review helps put people at ease coming here, it really is beautiful. The are closing for a refurbishment soon so I do hope to come back once done.",4,positive,"October 8, 2022",Avenida Estados Unidos Playa Arena Gorda,"('',)",La Altagracia Province,23302

The Hotel needs major upgrade but staff were pleasant and food was fine. Entertainment was sub par and music was all Spanish but we were fine with that.\nMy complaint has to do with the fact that the Front desk jeopardized the safety of two of the women which caused extreme upset and a severe invasion of privacy.\nOne of the reasons we stay at RIU\u2019s is security as we are women as friends.\nLast week (after we had been there several days) the front desk made a major error and checked-in two men into one of rooms already occupied. They gave the men two keys to room. The men proceeded to the room, unlocked the door and stepped in while one woman was getting out of shower with bathroom door open and the other woman was changing. It was TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE and an extremely upsetting violation of personal space and privacy.\nWe confiscated the keys from the gentlemen and immediately contacted the Front Desk who failed to answer phone. We left an irate message and demanded a call back which never happened.\nEventually a few of us went to Front Desk. They admitted that they knew about issue as the men had already told them an hour or two prior but they made no effort to contact us or apologize. The situation escalated when we explained the violation of personal space and safety. The employees spoke in Spanish so hard to tell what they were saying. We demanded a change in rooms for the two women in the room in question which was eventually agreed too but also meant that they 6 of us were in different areas of hotel and not together.\nThe 6 of us are extremely upset and if not already booked at another RIU for February (with 60 people) we would not be returning to RIU which is a shame as after going twice a year to RIU resorts all over the world for the last 20 years we were long term dedicated clients.\nOne bad experience will have major cascading negative impacts for the RIU organization.",1,negative,"December 1, 2022",Avenida Estados Unidos Playa Arena Gorda,"('',)",La Altagracia Province,23302

I think our last stay at an adults only resort in Mexico (Playa Mujeres) has ruined us for other resorts that at a 5* level simply cannot compare.  \n\nI will start by saying that the people of the DR are just beautiful and friendly people.  The staff are \uD83D\uDCAF.  Attentive and always ensuring your needs are met and you are having a good time.\n\nI have been to the Riu chain before in Mexico and have enjoyed.

Again I say this to ensure I am not attacked for making this post ...each person's opinions\u002Fexperiences are subjective.  While the resorts esthetics in the buildings are lovely and have a great vibe unfortunately the food and some of the drink options do not match up to the 5* level.\n\nWe are  certainly not foodies by any means and there is enough to \""get by\"" however I think my last experience has me expecting more.  The buffet at breakfast and lunch are extremely underwhelming.  Desserts most are beautiful but I can't live on desserts for a week :)\n\nDinner buffet is hit and miss. Our first night was lovely with fresh sushi, fish etc. Tonight absolutely nothing looked appealing and the buns could have served as a weapon they were hard and stale. \n\nPool grill is repetitive same thing every day and the the sports bar was serving stale nachos. Maybe others experiences have been better but for us it has been a big disappointment.\n\nLast night we took the advice of the Facebook page comments and went to the Steakhouse. We both had ribeye it was awful. Shoe leather and terrible table service. I read that the Steakhouse is the best one so now we are apprehensive to try the other 3.

Having to set an alarm for 6.30 when on holiday just to ensure that we had a bed for day is not good and even then we only had a limited choice.  It did seem unfair that those people who had managed to get a bali bed also felt the need to reserve two separate beds in the sun as well when there clearly was not enough beds to go round.\nAnother negative for us was that our room had a shower with a glass door that was open to the room - maybe ok for some but not for all.\nDespite this we had a good time and enjoyed our dose of winter sun.",4,positive,"February 16, 2023",Avenida Estados Unidos Playa Arena Gorda,"('',)",La Altagracia Province,23302

The beef teriyaki was basically a steak cut into big chunks with stir fry vegteables, very little sign of the sauce which had to be returned because the meat wasw over cooked and the dessert of rice cakes were in fact two truffles being served instead. The Italian and Steakhouse were ok, I am not sure why the Asian restaurant was called that because apart from one Chicken Tikka choice it wasn't asian food.

We didn\u2019t complain to our TUI rep whilst we were there as we didn\u2019t want to let it ruin our holiday we said we would just deal with it as we had already unpacked all of our luggage and we didn\u2019t want any of the hassle.

Me and my partner are a hardworking young couple and we are not really people that are picky or petty or complain about little things. But we both felt really let down on this holiday. Like I said we were sold a 5 star platinum accommodation and I would be pushing it if I said I was even a 4. The service of the hotel staff we are not complaining about or food as we were really happy with all that In general we just feel that the room we had really let it all down. There were ants in the room, mould on the ceiling in the shower, everything was rusty, there was a massive crack in the ceiling which let light in every morning, all of the shower cubicle glass blocks were all smashed and cracked, the room smelt damp when you walked in and I just had a total feeling of it not being clean the whole time. I had to shower with flip flops on as I didn\u2019t feel comfortable showering barefoot. There were also lights on the walkways around the hotel that had all loose wires sticking out (health and safety)This is not what you expect when you pay \u00A33500 for a 5 star platinum hotel. My partner wouldn\u2019t let me complain while we were there because like I said we had already unpacked all of our luggage and he didn\u2019t want to deal with all the hassle of moving rooms to just end up in one that was like for like as we spoke to a couple and they told us they had moved but it was just pretty much the same.

We were 50\u002F50 between the adults side and the kids side, so my review is on the entire resort rather than just La Perla. We had an amazing time and all the facilities are clean and well-maintained. The service is very good and almost all of the staff really tries to help you have a great trip. The food is decent for a Mexican resort and it seemed like they were trying to serve higher quality food than some of the other resorts I\u2019ve stayed at (I\u2019ve been to mexico more than a dozen times). However, there are some tidbits I have about the resort that I think would be helpful to know: \n\n- The roundtrip shuttle is operated by Otium. It is technically a shared shuttle service, but our two parties never had to share the ride on our 4 trips. When we arrived, they told us we had to wait up to 40 min for rest of people to come too, but no one ended up coming - only waited 15 minutes and then left \n- My number one dislike for this resort is there is very little nightly entertainment. They have a DJ that plays music in the evening, but no shows like other resorts have (fire shows, acrobats, elvis shows, etc). They had some shows on the kid friendly side, but it wasn\u2019t on the event board or the app for The Adults only side, so we had to find out through our friends on the kids side. Additionally, I had no idea what the daytime entertainment even was, and there\u2019s no explanation as to what the event is (Brazaletes, ritmos latinos, alebrijes, destilados mexicanos??) \n- Menus are online and don\u2019t always work (gives you an error page) and sometimes the staff were hesitant to just give a paper menu\n- Dress code is not strict but one guest was asked to change out of Mens tank top into a shirt that covered the shoulders. Shorts and sandals were fine though. \n- There is a timeshare program and they do approach, but they arent rude, however, once you make it clear you aren\u2019t interested in their presentation, they become quite cold.. they also keep approaching you knowing you\u2019ve said no already. It was super annoying.  \n- App can be frustrating to use and not all the features work.. i had to log out and log back in to make some features some back \n- Seaweed is cleaned in the mornings-early afternoon and the beach is quite nice and stays shallow for quite some distance - its great for older kids and adults (remember, it\u2019s the ocean, not a pool - it\u2019s going to have some seaweed and ocean matter..)\n- Restaurants are by appointment only and very busy. You can\u2019t make more than one dinner reservation per night, so if you have a short stay, you can\u2019t try more than one restaurant a day\n- Booking restaurant reservations could easily be done through the app, but instead they make you go to a designated counter (only open until 4pm) and sometimes you are waiting more than 30 minutes!! Theres only one person manning the reservation desk. The adults only side is much faster though \n- Breakfast buffet gets very very busy and doesn\u2019t have enough staff to help - we had to get up and find a waiter on many days of our stay to get a coffee\u002Ftea\n- Buffet for lunch and dinner is quite enjoyable, however, the service is much better, and the food is actually pretty good. The buffet is definitely on the smaller side compared to other places I\u2019ve been, but the main dishes are always something new and different. \n- Room service is quite prompt with a 45 min wait and very reliable. You get up to 2 free room services\u002Fday and if you do 3+ they charge you 100MXN. \n- We Locked ourselves out of the safe and got service within 20 min\n- The music is very unnecessarily loud - even the \u201Cquiet areas\u201D you can still hear the loud beats of the music and definitely from your room \n- There was a convention on the last day and the service was so poor for everyone else. Not a single waiter came by in 3 hours at the pool. We did go to the bar and lunch spot ourselves - when we ordered food, they said they would deliver it to where we were sitting in 10 minutes. We received the food an hour later. Still no waiters came around, however \n- Resort is on the smaller size - its very walkable and was very walkable with strollers as well. You don\u2019t need golf carts to get around, and the scenery is beautiful so the walk from one spot to the next goes by quick, but it can get a little boring as there arent many places to explore \n- Ice cream parlour is a nice touch but they rarely have any ice cream labelled which makes it hard with allergies. The staff also don\u2019t speak great english so they cant tell you what each one is. The ice cream is delicious though and we looked forward to it each day - but the hours were very inconvenient (only until 6pm so you couldn\u2019t get an after dinner treat)",4,positive,1 week ago,5 Av.

The entertainment is a lot of fun; from music to live videos where you\u2019re part of it to the club where we cap the night dancing away or just hanging out with dressed up people.  Some restaurants changed menus and yes, we were happy with the old ones but the new ones are so good you won\u2019t be disappointed.

He somehow knew we were coming and all that we like was already set in place for us.  Once I made it to the bar it was more like seeing an old friend and not a server.

All of our visits have been to the La Perla adult side except for 2020 when due to COVID-19, the resort was consolidated and only utilizing the La Esmeralda side.  We again vacationed there this May (2023) from arriving Friday May 19th and departing very early on Saturday May 27th.  We opted for a One Bedroom Master Suite as the upgrade was quite reasonably priced.\n\nFor the most part we had a very relaxing time.\n\nPrior to our arrival, I sent an email to the Concierge and Clara was able to book two of our dinner reservations in advance of our arrival which relieves stress and makes things so much easier than trying to book them once we\u2019ve arrived.\n\nThe check-in process went quickly seeing as our arrival on Friday 5\u002F19 was around 8:00pm partially due to a pit stop at a gas station by our shuttle from the airport for a tire that was leaking air \u2013 LOL so we opted to have dinner at the Hadar Buffet that evening which had a good variety and freshly grilled meats and was more than sufficient after an extremely long travel day.\n\nFor those that have never visited the resort, the area surrounding the outskirts of the resort is defiantly questionable, but once on the property, that does not even enter your mind.  Also, at no time have we felt unsafe at Paradisus.  The resort is well maintained and clean.  We genuinely feel unbelievably comfortable with the service and familiarity that we receive at Paradisus.\n\nOur days consist of following breakfast at the buffet, we hit the Pool Bar for a shot of tequila to start our day.  Basically we spend a good portion of the day at the Pool Bar taking in the poolside entertainment and meeting and conversing with other resort guest.  Around 3:00pm or so, my girlfriend would retire to our Bali Bed located poolside and occasionally I would join her.  We are also very respectful of the use of the Bali Beds so we made sure to let someone at the pool desk know when we are done utilizing it for the day as we do not want to abuse that privilege.\n\nThe pool area offered daily Water Aerobics at high noon followed by some type of entertainment.  Saturday there was a DJ which played music that was accompanied by: first a violinist moving around poolside followed by a saxophonist which we found to be interesting.  The remainder of the afternoon was the DJ.\n\nSunday there were three guys who called themselves The Beach Boys who accompanied the DJ music singing primarily Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons songs and not a single Beach Boys tune. \u2013 LOL  Again followed by DJ music for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nThe beach is a little bit of a walk from the pools and what I would rate as \u201Csufficient\u201D although nothing spectacular or special.  This is not an issue for us as we prefer the pool area and atmosphere.  There is a bar located near the beach as well as seating accommodations.  We are totally content with utilizing the pool area.\n\nShout outs go out to Staff Members that we have established relationships with as our \u201CFriends\u201D during previous visits. \u2013\n\n-\tRafael (Pool Desk La Esmeralda side) who gives a heads up to whoever is working the Pool Desk on the La Perla side to let them know that we are there.

The food was tasty but I think that their offering of \u201CTraditional\u201D Italian items was limited.  In the past they offered lasagna which I\u2019ve ordered and very much enjoyed. I\u2019m not sure if when the restaurant changed their name from Vento, they changed the menu. \n\nSunday for dinner we partook in Bana Teppanyaki which is a Hibachi prepared meal.  Per usual it was very good with an abundance of food being provided that we can never eat all of.\n\nMonday\u2019s dinner at Blue Agave Taqueria (Formerly The Market).  This is the first time that we\u2019ve experienced this restaurant and although it\u2019s basically only tacos, it was enjoyable and I would recommend it.\n\nTuesday we ate dinner at the Naos Buffet.  Neither of us cared for the food as it seemed as though they didn\u2019t have a very good selection.  Also we felt that the quality of the food was not up to par.  It also seemed that a lot of the offerings were geared to kids.\n\nWednesday we opted for Auquamarina which we\u2019ve eaten at once on a prior trip but weren\u2019t really impressed with but we decided to give another try.  Mind you that our past experience the offerings were appetizers, and entrees delivered to your table.  It has changed to buffet style and I\u2019m possibly even less impressed with it.  The selection of normal seafood fare doesn\u2019t seem to be there.  I would prefer what the restaurant was in its previous iteration as The Grill.\nThursday was Fuego night.  The steak which I had was deliciously tender.\n\nFriday we did the Hadar Buffet again but due to extenuating circumstances, the experience was far below what it was the previous Friday.  The selection didn\u2019t seem as expansive and the food in the trays didn\u2019t look as appealing as it seemed that it had been there for a while.\n\nWe truly miss La Palapa for dinner which was our favorite restaurant but it is now only available for breakfast and lunch to guests of The Reserve.\n\nI seldomly have had cons to mention from our visits.  I hope that I\u2019m not overreacting but this trip had a significant number of few things that bothered me.  When we did the Bana Teppanyaki experience back in December, we paid an additional $56.61 US to have a lobster to share added.  When we did the Bana Teppanyaki this trip, I asked if the lobster option was still available and the answer was yes.  To my fault, I simply said that we\u2019d like to have one each.  After the meal I needed to have the lobsters charged to the room.  I didn\u2019t look at the receipt until I got back to the room and to my surprise, I was charged $218.57 US for the two lobsters.  I was basically floored by the price increase of double in less than a period of six months.  I take the blame for not asking the price prior to agreeing to ordering the lobster, but I still feel taken advantage of.\n\nOn Monday when we ate at the Blue Agave Taqueria, there were off property merchants set up in the hallway area.  All of the vendors were trying to entice us into coming to their booths which made me feel extremely uncomfortable.  It made me wonder why on earth the resort felt that this was a good idea. \n\nADJ and tipped him $5 saying \u201CIn respect to Tina Turner, could you please play some of her songs\u201D.  The entire afternoon passed without hearing a single Tina Turner song after he accepted the $5.  I felt like I had \u201CMARK\u201D stamped on my forehead.\n\nLater in the afternoon on Tuesday, Alfonso from Guest Services came by our Bali Bed asking if everything was ok with our stay to which we explained the situation of the $218 lobsters at Bana Teppanyaki which we felt taken advantage of.  He seemed genuinely surprised and indicated that he wasn\u2019t sure but he thought that the price should have been more in the neighborhood of $50 per tail.  He asked for our room number having written it down on his tablet and said that he would check into it for us.  I asked when he would be in the La Pela pool area again he said that he would be there the following afternoon.  Wednesday came and went without an Alfonso sighting.  We didn\u2019t see Alfonso for the remainder of the trip which gave me the feeling that he was being disingenuous.\n\nOn Friday (our last full day), we became casualties of a labor dispute.  Friday morning when we went for breakfast at Hadar at around 10:00am we found it to be closed.  We then ventured over to Naos which upon entering was deafening with the amount of people in the restaurant not to mention that they allow children in that restaurant where Hadar was not.  The woman seating us asked if the table that she was seating us at was ok or if we\u2019d like to be seated across the hall at Blue Agave.  I felt that the noise was unbearable so we asked to be seated across the hall.  The downside with that is it is open air and it was a bit humid.  I asked the woman seating us why Naos wasn\u2019t open and she never gave me an answer.  We noticed that all of the workers were supervisors many of whom appeared flustered.  I thought that one who was waiting our table\u2019s head was going to explode when I asked for water with ice.  We later found out that there was a walk out by the wait staff, bartenders and housekeeping over a labor dispute.  Supervisors\u002FManagement were filling their positions.  Over the course of the day, we had to kind of retrain the Pool Bar bartender who was a supervisor but we got through it.  About 2:30pm in the afternoon, the staff returned however their was still residual effects.  The Sunset Grill was operating with a \u201CLimited\u201D menu which was upsetting because essentially I wasn\u2019t getting what I had paid for as well as Room Services \u201CLimited\u201D menu only consisted of things like burgers, hot dogs & chicken tenders.  A far cry from being able to order steaks and pasta dishes etc.  That was the reason why we wound up going to dinner at the Hadar Buffet that evening.  Again I felt that I wasn\u2019t being offered what I had paid for without any type of compensation being offered.  Supervisors\u002FManagement were very tight-lipped on offering any type of information as to what was going on during the walk out.\n\nIt appears that the resort is going through some changes and in my opinion not all for the better which blame falls on the shoulders of Management.  But as far as the working class staff goes, they truly do a wonderful job at making us feel relaxed and comfortable.   \n",4,positive,"June 9, 2023",5 Av.

And as such much of this resorts amenities are dependant on the sister resort, like many of the restaurants as well as the beach. In selecting a resort, we have 3 criteria, food, beach and adults only. Food was only ok, nothing stood out as exceptional, some of the restaurants at the sister resort like The Market BBQ was downright bad. There are a limited number of Ala Carte restaurants at LA Perla so if you want variety you are required to book at the sister resort, Playa del Carmen. Be prepared for children running amuck inside the restaurants over there. I guess their parents must figure they are on vacation too and can't be bothered. \nMoving on to the beach, there is a beach at LA Perla, however there are no chairs set up there, at least while we were there. We asked many many times why not and could not get more than a shrug of the shoulders as an answer.  If you want to lay on the beach, you were forced to walk about a half km down the beach to the sister resort, heads up though, like the restaurants,  that's where all the children are, running amuck. \nThere are many good thing to say about this resort though. We received an unexpected upgrade to a one bedroom suite which was fantastic. Our concierge, Plutarco, was absolutely fantastic. He booked all our restaurant reservations, no waiting in line at 7 am to make a reservation.  \nThe evening entertainment was nice at the South Bar, however the furniture was horribly uncomfortable. And be prepared for the smokers to be everywhere especially if you are a non smoker. And I'm talking about inside the buildings, you just couldn't get away from the stink.  \nSo in review, this is not a five star resort, it's four star at most.

The ONLY negative, which is of personal issue, the music around the pool on a daily basis was very very loud.

My boyfriend is gluten free and didn't have trouble finding good food to eat at each place.  When you first arrive you are always asked if anyone has allergies.  At other resorts sometimes when we were asked this question, you could tell some people didn't quite understand what gluten free meant.  It wasn't like that at this resort. Often times the waiter would come back from the kitchen with info such as something not being gluten free because they use the same fryer as for other food, etc. which was reassuring.  He did find his options were limited at the buffet but could have an omelette and fruit each morning which he was fine with. \n\nBeach\u002FPool - We splurged (for us) and upgraded to Reserve which we were VERY thankful for once we saw the adult only pool.  The regular adult only pool has a DJ every day from about noon to supper with music SO loud so it was not a relaxing environment at all and there were also no umbrellas so you were pretty much guaranteed to roast in the sun.   The reserve pool was quieter and there were umbrellas.  The reserve section on the beach was also great (it looked like the adults only section of the beach was pretty good too with some bali beds).   So for the kind of vacation we like (reading, relaxing), had we not done reserve we would have been incredibly disappointed.    We had no issues getting chairs\u002Fbali beds but nearing the end of our stay we heard capacity was around 50% because they were expecting a large corporate event so I'm not sure how busy it would feel when the place is full.   The beach had a lot of seaweed but they were working on cleaning it up every day (seemed like a never ending battle for them as there was a lot) but it didn't smell so we didn't care!\n\nService - AMAZING.  Honestly, everyone at the resort, no matter what their role is, seems to be genuinely happy to be there.   The service was like nothing we have experienced at other resorts and could not have been better.  \n\nRoom - Our room was really nice.  We had a junior suite garden view (we ended up with a pool view which was really nice at night). I'm not sure if some of the resort had been redone since from when the photos on the hotel website were taken, but our room was more modern than the website showed.   Bed was really comfy. \n\nI would definitely recommend this resort.  We splurged a bit and it was more expensive than a resort we would typically go to but it was worth it given we hadn't travelled in a few years.",5,positive,"February 19, 2023",5 Av.

The pool, the bars and restaurants, the activities, the beach as well as the close proximity to the town of Playa Del Carmen were exactly what we wanted and needed. The rooms were very clean and spacious and the bed and bedding were very comfortable. The hot tub on the balcony was used every day after pool time.

So here it is.\n\nPROS:\n\n- No kids!\n- Beautiful resort.. very clean & very detail oriented\n- Many restaurants to choose from & they were all good \n- Rooms are very large & patio is great (we were upgraded to a Master suite which was a waste of space in my opinion.  Huge kitchen table & counter , but NO amenities .. so what's the point??) \n- Beach was nice & well kept up\n- Bars everywhere you turn\n- Great selection of drinks & alcohol .. even the frozen ones were from a blender, not a machine!\n- Staff were all very friendly & willing to help\n- Resort size was perfect .. not too small , but not walking for miles to get somewhere\n- You can use all the amenities on the \""kids\"" side when you stay on this side... beware if you book the other side .. even in Jan is was FULL of kids.. more than any resort I had seen before\n- Room service was fantastic..  We should have done that for breakfast EVERY day\n- Pool bar food was AMAZING!  Not just your typical burgers, dogs, pizza.. it was sliders, burgers, sandwiches, wings , cheese... fantastic\n- You HAVE to go to the M Bar... best drinks ever!   Huge shout out to MAGO.. he is so friendly & made the best martinis I have ever had :)\n\nCONS:\n\n- The pool is FREEZING, FREEZING, FREEZING!!  I have NEVER been to a resort where the pool was this cold.   Some of the guys were able to get used to it, but there were hardly any girls in the pool the entire week..  most of them sat on the edge or didn't get in at all.   The ocean water was definitely warmer.\n- There were never enough chairs at the pool.   Mon-Weds weren't bad, but once Thurs. came, we could not get chairs.  We had to rent a cabana for 2 days (and they are all shaded) because we could not get chairs.  We even got up at 7:30 on Sat morning & only got 1 chair.. at 7:30 am!!!!   There is more room for chairs, but for whatever reason, the resort doesn't add more?\n- The pool is .. FREEZING COLD!  I saw this in MANY reviews for the past year & the hotel responds with \""we are sorry, we try to keep it comfortable for everyone\"".  However, it wasn't comfortable for ANYONE.   \n- You had to make a reservation EVERY night for EVERY restaurant.   That was a bit of a pain as you don't always know what the day will bring.\n- Beach was ok, but the beach bar was far away from the chairs.\n- Have I mentioned the how COLD the pool was???  And you could hear everyone talking about it... it definitely was not just our group.\n\nIn conclusion, it was a great resort.   We personally will not ever go back ... and the ONLY reason is the pool.   We are HUGE pool people & spend 80% of our time there.   We aren't big beach or excursion people.    So for us to not be able to spend time IN the pool or around it because of a lack of chairs is a huge deal breaker for us.

data/ca/154998/1467310/656080684.html,Niagara&#39;s Emerald Falls Bed &amp; Breakfast,"""This is a similar review I left on the website I booked our room (with updated feedback from my response I was given)\n\nThe room was clean. The bed was comfortable. No problems with the jetted tub. Reasonably priced and the location is within walking distance to the falls. Would love to comment on the breakfast, but there was none! \nI will take responsibility in naively assuming breakfast comes in staying at a 'B&B' but it is disappointing in finding out one of the key reasons you book a place (i.e online reviews complimenting on the breakfast) to be told there will be none. Doesn't help when they have an open guestbook from guests staying a month ago stating how wonderful their breakfast was! \n\nAlthough booked our room 'off season' the overall experience staying here felt like we were an inconvenience to them. The old looking and overly bleached colour towels we were given had seen better days (there is a reason most places have white towels!), the 8 sheets of toilet paper left hanging for us with no replacement on stand by seemed a little harsh. \nWhen asking about using the fireplace that didn't turn on easily the gentleman who showed us to our room stared at us blankly and wasn't sure himself and asked why we would want to use it....because it's the middle of February? Or because it might be nice? We didn't bother in the end. \nOverall, not the best B&B experience and although we do plan on visiting the falls again, we won't plan on staying here.\n\n*Update*\n\nSo the response concerning the breakfast:\n\""There was a misunderstanding about the breakfast, we can not provide breakfast for some reason.\""\n\nAlthough I am curious what that reason may be... it is still a warning to those reading these reviews to not base your decision when people highly praise something you might not be given. I still find it pretty misleading when a place is described as a 'B&B' and only one is provided, but never mind!\n\n'it should show on your reservation. and that is why the price is so 'reasonable' as you said. '\n\nAnother way at looking at it being 'reasonably' priced because at the time in booking it was off season. However, you are in control with the prices but I deliberately paid extra to stay at your B&B because of the highly praised reviews that gave exemplary feedback concerning the breakfast and nice rooms. For whatever reason we were not provided breakfast and for the 'reasonable' price I did pay, I could easily have paid the same (and in some cases less) for a room that did include breakfast. I hold my hands up in that I made the error in assuming breakfast would be provided. I just find it unusual, for whatever reason that we did not. \n\n'For the fire place in the room, i believe it is just for decoration, no one had used it before.'\n\nYou might want to double-check the fireplace because it did look like more than a decoration, but I am not 100 per cent certain on that. Even so, the confusement given when it is the heart of winter as to why we might want to the fire on still baffles me! As to ask us why we would want it on is also confusing as why wouldn't we?\n\n'Sorry we didt provide white towles like hotels, but they are definitely clean' \n\nI never said the towels were dirty. They were clean but very old looking. I don't think every B&B provide white towels, but there is a reason most places probably do! (They can be bleached and not look\u002Ffeel old). I admit, this is only a minor complaint but if want to make a good impression you might want to treat your guests with nicer towels! I probably should have packed a few in my case! \nYou never did reply as to why we were given a practically empty toilet roll despite two guests staying in your room. Again, it is the small touches that make a big impression as the vibe of the whole of our stay felt like we were an inconvenience.  \n\nSummary:\n\nOverall, I didn't expect the red carpet treatment, despite how this may sound. Having stayed at just one other B&B in the falls that was 'a night to remember' ;) I remember how different it was than just a regular hotel which is why I opted for another B&B stay. I was however hoping for more of the same or something close to what we experienced the last time round. My biggest mistake was expecting breakfast at a B&B, a mistake I won't make again. My other fault was having the bar set high and I made my other mistake thinking this place could compete. \nHaving said all that I wish you all well and am sorry it just didn't work out with us.",1,negative,"March 3, 2019",4291 Simcoe St,"('Niagara Falls',)",Ontario,L2E 1T5

There are so many good things to say about Susan' Villas it's hard to know where to begin, so I'll break it into sections:\n\n1) Location, location, location: The Ontario Avenue location (where our suite was situated along with three other suites) is incredible. It is in a very nice residential area that is mere blocks from all of the hoopla surrounding Niagara Falls. We walked to the falls every day and again in the evenings so there was no worries of driving, parking, etc. Then later at night and in the mornings the area is soooo quiet! You'd never know you were in a large tourist area. Did I mention the location??\n\n2) Accommodations: Our room (again the 'No Name' suite) had all the features you need in a home away from home. Nice comfortable queen size bed in a room with a large closet, and dresser with a night stand on each side of the bed. The second room had a single bed and a pull out couch - which would have been great if our daughter had been traveling with us. Both of these rooms also had a television. A large bathroom and a small refrigerator rounded out the furnishing. All very nice and all very clean. The rest of the house was kept immaculate. The kitchen and dining area (where we enjoyed our breakfasts) were well appointed and very well maintained. Out back was a large deck and gazebo with plenty of seating for multiple families if necessary. All of this wrapped in nicely manicured yard \u002F gardens. You can tell these folks really take care of their property!\n\n3) Hospitality: Susan and Edwin are simply really good people. Susan is just the sweetest! Even though we had a (very) slight language barrier, her English was good enough that we could communicate without issues. Her breakfasts were spot on, plentiful and had a nice variety. You can tell she really loves people! As for Edwin, he had a great sense of humor and was incredibly helpful. We dealt with him during the booking process, and he gave us great advice on all of the local sites - plus some locations outside of Niagara. We were even treated to a few stories about his homeland Germany. You just can't ask for anything more in hosts than what was provided by Susan and Edwin!\n\nI would also like to add a few comments in rebuttal to a couple of recent reviews I've seen on TripAdvisor. We were a very late arrival - not getting in until well after 11:00 PM our first night. Special arrangements were made via Edwin to ensure we could get into our suite without any trouble. The next morning breakfast was served and not a word was mentioned regarding our final payment. I finally brought up our outstanding balance a few hours later and the final payment process was perfectly smooth. Also, as to air conditioning, we were never uncomfortable during our stay. We noticed that when it was hotter, the windows were closed and the AC was on. When it was a bit cooler outside the AC was off and windows were open. The temperature in the house and in our suite never fluctuated much, so we had NO issues with AC.\n\nAll in all our stay here was fantastic.

We rented the pine and domino suites for two families for a Saturday and Sunday at the end of July and there was ample space.\n\nBreakfast was also excellent.\n\nHowever, as soon as we arrived Edwin was fairly insistent on me signing the checks for the room.  I believe this was because we had originally booked for two nights and then tried to reduce the booking of one of the suites to one night only.  Edwin had emailed me to say they would not be able to sell the one night and so we would have to pay for both.  I had already paid half as a deposit so I had no choice really.  The whole check in process made us feel uncomfortable.  At this point we also mentioned the need for air condition so the rooms were not uncomfortable at night time.  Edwin assured us that it would be on but that it might go off in the night.  When we returned to our rooms at about 11pm the air condition had already gone off and there was of course no-one around to put it right.  As a consequence we all had a difficult night.  Now we are from England and not used to air-con, but our friends from New Jersey found it particularly sticky and got little sleep.  We mentioned this in the morning to Susan but received little assurance that it would be put right for the second night.  As a consequence, our friends dropped us at Buffalo train station for our train to Toledo and then drove home through the night to New Jersey, thus avoiding a second nightime sauna but obviously losing the payment already made for the second night.\n\nPlease, Edwin, ensure that you are not so difficult about the air con as it ruined what would have otherwise been a lovely stay and a much higher rating.",3,negative,"August 8, 2014",5481 Ontario Ave,"('Niagara Falls',)",Ontario,L2E 3S4

For the first time ever in over five years, the reviews proved wrong and we ended up in the worse place we have ever stayed. We would definitely not recommend this motel to anyone. We initially made a reservation on line but, in checking to make sure it had been made, we inadvertently made a second one for the same dates. We were aware there might be a $25 cancellation fee but my husband called within five minutes of our mistake and spoke with the owner of the motel, explained what had happened and were told he'd \""take care of it.\""  He took care of it alright and charged us not $25 but $29.  Having no choice other than paying another $29 to cancel, we kept the original reservation and arrived in town about 1:30.  Although we knew we couldn't check in until after 2, we stopped by the office to let them know we were in town and hopefully get some information\u002Fmaps of the general area so we could see some of the sights and then check in later that afternoon.  Though the sign in the office window said \""Open,\"" the door was locked and despite ringing the bell multiple times, no one came to the door.  A motel guest who saw us out front, called the office to alert them we were there but still no one came.  \nAs for the room, there were multiple problems.  The fan in the bathroom rattled the whole time it was on.  Their was no stopper in the bathtub.  I went to the office to inquire about an ice machine and was told there were ice trays in the refrigerator in our room.  There were two electrical outlets that were accessible but only one of them worked.  There were three lamps in the room but no overhead light.  The lamps had rheostats but the light bulbs were not intended for use with rheostats, so they flickered all the time.  The window air conditioner was too small for the window, thus light and bugs came in all around the AC.  Outside, under each unit's AC was a plastic bucket; this was both unattractive and a nuisance to navigate around. The free breakfast each morning held little variety and was even more unappealing due to the fly strips that hung next to the food.  A sign indicated that nothing was to be taken from the breakfast room and, if food was found in the room, there would be an extra clean up charge. On the last day of our stay, we returned to our room late afternoon to find the door ajar.  When we reported this, we were told simply \""Oh, the cleaning staff must not have gotten the door shut tight.\""  There was no concern or apology.  The parking places closest to the stairs were never available for motel guests but were always filled with the owners' cars.  \nObviously, this establishment engages in business practices that appeared to be sketchy.

The B&B has three guest rooms, all on the second floor, approachable by a private entrance. The living room and kitchen are shared by all guests - with full kitchen privileges included. A refrigerator, stove, microwave and a full compliment of flatware and dishes were provided for our convenience. A full breakfast is cooked to order every morning of your stay if so desired.\n\nOur room had a King size bed, flat screen television with cable, shared balcony and private bath which included shampoo and linens.Extra pillows and a hair blow dryer were also provided. The bed was a little hard for my traveling mate, though just fine for myself. I did take my own pillows from home.\n\nNo need for a car if you stay here. Everything is within walking distance, or purchase a WEGO pass. The WEGO stop is just a short distance away. With WEGO you can traverse the entire Niagara region for one low cost for 24 or 48 hours. Uber is also available (Lyft does not operate in Canada at this time).\n\nThis B&B sure beats a stuffy hotel. Providing all the comforts of home for an affordable price.

data/ca/154998/252841/775517207.html,Niagara Grandview Boutique Hotel,"""This is not a short, concise review and will apologize for that now. We have been tormented by unwillingly having to relive our recent stay at The Niagara Grandview since our return over two weeks ago. We simply cannot shake this off. In fact, this is the very first time in five decades of travelling my wife and I felt so compelled to document and share our horrific experience in detail.\n\nWe have booked the Grandview Manor exclusively on four occasions over the past three years as it has been our \u2018go to\u2019 destination in Niagara Falls. With great disappointment, that has now all changed. We won't be staying there again.\n\nIt would be a gross understatement to say our recent stay was unnecessarily aggravating, stressful and full of unpleasant surprises. Considering everything happening in our world right now, we were just going to let this go and move on, but upon reflection felt strongly about bringing our inexcusably upsetting nightmare to the attention of anyone who may be considering this establishment.\n\nAs a result of a number of documented emails and phone calls directly with the Inn (in an effort to help avoid the often common mishaps of booking through a third party), we were made to feel like nothing but an annoyance and inconvenience. In spite of this, we decided to confirm our fourth stay with them anyway, so we booked \u201CThe Fraser\u201D room. After been repeatedly assured it was renovated with specific amenities including a covered balcony - information the owner personally confirmed and provided in writing - we discovered upon check-in that the room clearly has no covered balcony. As COVID-19 limits a substantial amount of one\u2019s activities, the ability to enjoy the room and relax within some outside personal 'space' is important now more than ever. It has always been important to us to be able to sit outside regardless of weather, as we have done on our three previous stays with this establishment.\n\nBeyond this inexcusable \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 (?), there was only one chair on the balcony (with nothing appropriate or usable inside to move), so it would obviously not accommodate a couple. What was equally upsetting was that our lodging was merely another stale, tired, weathered room with no redeeming features expected of an historic property at this price point, in an area of the Inn that was dark, dingy, and dirty and STILL under construction after almost THREE years. All of their alleged 'renovations' and high-tech shower did not compensate for the absence of cleanliness, charm and ambience. Let it go on record we have never had any such issues during our earlier stays in The Annex, an adjacent property we greatly enjoyed, which Niagara Historic Inns lost earlier this year after it was reacquired and beautifully renovated by its owners.\n\nHaving gone to great lengths to ensure the details of our booking, we addressed our confusion and disappointment with the Front Desk immediately. In response, we were offered either a full refund or an alternative room in the Alexandria Villa, a newly acquired property nearby (with no balconies). We reluctantly accepted and coordinated a switch of rooms. This not only avoided the property having to incur a loss of revenue but more importantly us having to request a refund which could be difficult, based on other reviews and our experience of having to reschedule our Spring booking - PAID IN ADVANCE IN FULL with cancelled with AMPLE notice - only to be told by the owner he would just \u201Chang on to our money until next time\u201D We were understandably nervous and skeptical a refund would never be issued. So we stayed.\n\nBut so far that was NOTHING... Returning from dinner Thursday evening we noticed something odd in the kitchen. Opening the door, we saw food in Tupperware containers on the counter so only assumed it was someone on site (possibly staff?) checking the property and locking up for the evening. We thought little of it at the time. Less than 30 minutes later, however, a food delivery arrived and there was a group gathered in the kitchen\u002Fdining area eating and socializing.\n\nThey became disrespectfully noisy with their banging and chatter continuing until close to midnight. We didn\u2019t complain or make an issue of this due to what had happened at check-in so just let it go even though it was clearly against the establishment\u2019s long list of official and strict printed guest guidelines.\n\nFriday evening, however, was an inexcusable nightmare. Upon returning from a relaxing afternoon and dinner, we opened the main front door to discover the Villa disgustingly redolent with burned cooking oil and the nauseating smell of greasy food. The odor spread throughout the interior of the building. At least 6 people or more, all without masks, were loudly carrying on and eating on the main floor. We had to deal with breathing and choking on this as it had overtaken our entire room.\n\nAfter enduring this for almost an hour, we decided to ask who they were, why they were cooking and eating in the Villa when the guest rule sheet does NOT allow it and requested they open a window or turn on a fan. No one appeared to understand except one young woman who informed us flippantly they were \u201Cguests\u201D, were cooking \u201CHot Pot\u201D then sarcastically suggested that \u201Cwe should join them\u2019... an insensitive and insulting remark in a COVID environment to join people we don\u2019t know - who are not socially distancing and not wearing masks - to eat food in close quarters with strangers whom we were not even able to communicate with?\n\nAfter this obnoxious encounter, it was impossible to enjoy the evening, our room or a much needed relaxing soak in the Jacuzzi tub we had paid a premium price for. The evening and our one and only get-away this year due to COVID restrictions was completely destroyed and ruined. We were forced to open all our windows and retire early after packing up knowing we would leave first thing in the morning.\n\nWe dropped our key off by 9am and left without breakfast, once a key highlight which everyone raves about and which we always enjoyed. It is now much reduced. The Eggs Benedict were still ok but was the only hot item left, as the other offerings were only the standard mix of granola, fruit and bagels all of which are available at any Travel Lodge, Best Western or Quality Inn at a fraction of the cost.\n\nCompletely exhausted and upset, we just needed to go home without having to deal with an unpleasant or indifferent encounter with the owner.\n\nAs our stay was like any other in the past, after returning home we did reach out to him by email with a summary and questions concerning our experience. He chose to ignore us. Having to follow up days later, we were only blasted with a shockingly condescending, arrogant and hurtful reply. He accused us of not having the \u2018courage' to mention anything at check out, of always complaining (?) - and did not even have the courtesy to address or even comment on a single concern or issue we had. That was totally shameful, especially from the perspective of repeat and loyal customers.\n\nIt is also important to note we have in the past, left positive, glowing reviews for both the Grandview and their incredible staff.

Stayed across street at Hilton but we walked around the resort quite a bit. \nOne big positive I saw is that kids can now eat at Ponte Vecchio since they added an exterior entrance from the shop area. Noodle Bar has had a few food changes but is still my favorite. Now the negatives. Craps table gone replaced with electronic craps. hate it. The Falls Deli is sit down now and you can't take your food to go. makes no sense you can't take your food back to your room. Huge mistake closing the buffet. That brought people in to play. Instead, it's now a sports bar with ridiculously high prices. Hot dog and pop is $22. Really?\n\nNow the drink service. They charge for bottled water. Tap water, tea, coffee and soft drinks are free but you pay for bottled water. ($1.25)\n\nBut the worst of all is the parking situation. It should be a criminal offense how they handle parking. I pulled in the lot on A friday afternoon and the sign posted said $35. However, I never got a ticket or swiped my card when I entered the lot so it got me to thinking how do they know what i owe when I leave the lot. I checked with front desk and it turns out you pay the parking rate based on when you leave. \nThat is absolutely ridiculous. Nobody buys food at a restaurant without first knowing the cost. So why would the casino think it's fair to not tell me up front the parking rate when I enter the garage.\nThe women at the front desk (red head) was incredibly rude to me when explaining this. She even went so far as to tell me they dont give you a ticket when you come in the garage because it is a waste of paper. LOL. What a joke to tell me that. They give plastic cups with drinks, but cant print out tickets that are 2 inches long. \n\nWhile I was able to ge parking free when leaving, nobody at the tables, VIP desk, hotel knew the criteria necessary to earn free parking. There is no reason to not be transparent with your policies. Its nothing more than a big money grab given the old parking rates were $5, no more than $25 at any given time. \n\nI really do like the casino resort but the parking situation makes me question how often I want to come back, especially given all the choices I have within a close drive to me.

My husband and I have been longtime patrons of Fallsview Casino Resort, both the hotel and the casino. We have made the decision to take our money to Casinorama. The cutbacks Fallsview has made since COVID are downright offensive. No longer do they have drink carts going around the floor - when asked why, the server said they didn\u2019t want people standing around in crowds by the drink cart because of Covid. Ok. That\u2019s fine, but then put more servers on the floor!!  My husband and I were there today for 9 hours - I was asked twice in that 9 hours if I wanted a drink. Husband said he was only asked once.  And when we go up to the bar to order our own drink, bottled water is a charge, hot chocolate is a charge - and the servers at the bar are just waiting for a tip - I order soda.  No alcohol. I have to leave my machine, walk up to the bar and order my own drink - I\u2019m not tipping you for pouring soda in a cup. Sorry. \nThe Grand Buffet is now closed permanently.  It doesn\u2019t surprise us since after they reopened after the pandemic, they shortened the buffet hours, increased the price from  approx $35 pp to $55 pp and it wasn\u2019t even close to the quality it was before. The greed at the top has become a detriment to their business. Even parking on concert nights - depending on who is playing\u2026$60 for the event. And that is SELF PARK. \nTHEY HAVE a new restaurant in place of the Grand Buffet - a sports pub\u002Fbar named \u201COvertime\u201D. Food not that great and sooo expensive. We ordered a pretzel - yes a soft pretzel with cheese dip - $15!!!  I kid you not.

LOCATION: Due to covid,  we didn't want to stay right in the middle of all the tourist attractions, so this worked out well.  We were mainly visiting Niagara-on-the-Lake and other towns along the wine route, and this facility worked out really conveniently as a bit of a base.  We did drive to the Falls themselves one evening - it was super close.  There are no real grounds or anything at the hotel, and some of the surrounding area isn't the greatest, but it is a short drive to restaurants, parks, and otherwise.  It was also nice to be situated along the river parkway and made for a convenient drive either to other towns in our plans or to tourist destinations or to restaurants.  HOTEL: it was very quiet when we were there; not sure how many guests were checked-in (note: we went mid-week, not a weekend) but despite it being a quiet time, the staff at the front desk were very nice every time we passed by.  As others have noted, there are no elevators which didn't bother us, but worth noting for others.  We stayed on the 2nd floor so didn't have much of a view from the room, but that wasn't a priority for us.  They did have breakfast - looked like a mixture of hot and cold items - and that breakfast room seemed clean with good covid protocols as well.  I only grabbed a coffee so didn't eat any of it, felt kinda' bad for the staff member working there room as there was no one else there!  Hope other guests took advantage of the breakfast so nothing went to waste. ROOM: really good size (2 queen beds, standard room) and exceptionally clean for a budget hotel.  All in-room amenities - WiFi, TV, coffee maker, mini-fridge, hairdryer worked fine.  I would have liked more accessible outlets to plug in various devices, but so few hotels have enough that it wasn't unusual to have to unplug a light in order to plug in devices. As others have mentioned, the bathroom was small but nothing too unusual - I've stayed in far worse for sure.  The hallways were very hot in temperature (we were travelling during a humid, muggy heatwave) but the in-room air conditioner worked really well (yay!).  All-in-all, it was very good value for the price and while I don't know what it is like during a \""normal\"" summer, it was a good choice for us for a short stay during the 2nd covid summer!

However they quickly escorted us to an available room without any issue. The house is very clean and as I mentioned seems like it was built with the intention of becoming a bed and breakfast. The rooms were clean and spacious and have a look of a hotel room with all the amenities you would expect in a hotel. The bathroom was clean and had complimentary soap and shampoo. If you need conditioner you will need to bring your own.\nBreakfast is served every day around 9 o'clock in the morning breakfast seem to have a set schedule on what was going to be cooked each days I'm sure if there were specific request they would accommodate which we did not need. typically you had fruit first along with the days meal we had the French toast which was okay. The owners were really friendly and seem generally interested in what we wanted to do for the day they gave suggestions and tips as well as provided some brochures on what we could do for the day there were also coupons for a winery tours on the table at the entrance. As well as complimentary cookies at the front which gave the place a more homey feel.\nIn the hallway there is a mini fridge microwave and DVD movies that you can borrow for free and watching in your room if you're looking for a little bit of entertainment during the evening.\n As a friendly tip if your booking through a third party make sure you call and speak to the owners before you leave to ensure they're ready for your arrival.\nOverall it was a great experience and if you book this bed and breakfast you will not regret your decision.",4,positive,"November 19, 2015",4741 Zimmerman Ave,"('Niagara Falls',)",Ontario,L2E 3M8

What a nice surprise! \nPicture of our view. \n\nWe crossed past the Tims beside us and there's already Starbucks and eating places and a pathway already to the falls. I'm not a walker and I was at the falls so quickly!!!! There's a fountain in the park along the pathway for pictures and a few steps more I was already at The Midway arcade where the kids wanted to be. Amazing walking score! (Did I mention I hate walking?! I totally enjoyed the walk-it didn't pass through alleys or anything non pleasing to the eye!) \n\nAlthough the fridge is like everyone says, Its a basic air-conditioned room with a clean bed. We didn't have a microwave but please realize that even other hotels removed coffee makers and such for hygiene reasons since COVID. \nBe responsible take care of the room as you would your own place and  maintain it for other patrons. \n\nI'm extremely picky with beds and pillows so I have to say I really liked how comfy the pillows and bed were. \nNOTE : If you also love bed sheets, pillow cases and comforters with texture and shabby chic style like I do to help fall asleep, then bring your own. Otherwise for those just needing clean inside bed sheets, you'll be fine, nothing else needed:)\n\n  The people were sweet to us. I love supporting local Canadian businesses especially this one. I read on their window they go back from 1937. Help each other and help the community that brings so many people from around the world. \n\nComing back with our furry family member again. \nPs sorry for the long review I just think that the reviews were more rough than needed to be and I'm super picky but didn't find any fault. If this review allows questions please ask me. Ps about the parking rate reviews I hate to say it but jeez if u want parking this close to the falls it can and will fluctuation. I've noticed this in surrounding areas since I was 18!(who the heck hasn't?!) from $10 - 20 is not unreasonable. I've paid empty lots from$5 to$25 depending on the occasion\u002Fseason. The Sheraton and Crowne charge $25-30 and you'll still end up parking near roof or circling for 45 minutes to get in and 1 hour or more stuck behind a lineup in the garage to get out during checkout hour. It's a choice and you make it. Take it or leave it and don't complain. \n\nOne question I have for those looking in this price range is, could the value you expected be too high? No white glove service but for the price, they met all my needs and I'm pretty much an independent traveler and with the kids always come prepared.",4,positive,"September 5, 2022",5581 Murray St 3 Minute Walk To The Falls Across From Casino,"('Niagara Falls',)",Ontario,L2G 2J6

Our rooms have never had microwaves or fridges, or even an acceptable amount of electrical outlets for charging devices. The plus, is the balcony (other than the huge planters blocking our view). Karaoke starts early. At first, we don't mind the not so great sounding singers at times, but as the day passes, a headache begins, we became annoyed with the music and eachother and the only way to drown that is to drink. So if you come to Niagara to drink and party, this is the perfect spot for you. If you prefer quiet, peaceful and relaxed, you should find a hotel elsewhere. Parking is not cheap and no breakfast is included, you get a discount voucher for an overpriced restaurant next door. I am saddened to say, as I am getting older, I will probably not stay here again.",3,negative,"August 14, 2019",4945 Clifton Hill Rainbow Bridge\u002FFalls Ave,"('Niagara Falls',)",Ontario,L2G 3N5

However, we had a balcony and we could sit outside on the mismatched chairs and hear the falls while staring at the casino. We quickly noticed our floor seemed to have been rehabbed based on the flooring. When you step out of the elevator, which jumps and hops as it comes to a not-so-gentle landing at your floor, the first thing you see are gleaming hardwood, or very good imitation of such, floors of varying colors. They are beautiful. The floors continue into the room, which is large and decorated in what I would describe as Tuscan meets Victorian, with fancy drapes, a chandelier and candelabras on the wall as sconces. The bed is super comfortable with a variety of pillows. The bathroom is smaller with a whirlpool tub for one and a tile on the walls that is leftover from a few decades ago. However, replacing those tiles is expensive, so instead, they blended them in with nice paint and a new tile floor. Water pressure was excellent. \n\nBreakfast hours are from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and the room is pretty large. A woman mans the coffee station to make sure coffee is ready at the self-serve canisters. She also cleans the tables, although you are expected to bus your table, as you should. You receive a card when you arrive that requests you limit your breakfast to 45 minutes, which is reasonable since guests do need to rotate through.\n\nSo, what is kind of off? I have no idea what the other rooms look like, but I do know the hallways of the other floors have grungy carpet with a moldy smell to them, making me grateful we were upstairs on the gleaming floors. Call the hotel and request a room with the new floors.\n\nHere are the issues you can decide if you can live with: Our TV was weird. It would refuse to turn off, and then it wouldn't have a signal, and then it would be fuzzy, and then refuse to turn off...repeat. We suspect housekeeping had an issue with it because when we returned to our room at night, our TV was on. Or maybe the TV turned on by itself. \n\nThe internet was spotty. We would be connected and then we wouldn't. Repeat.\n\nWhile the bed was comfortable, the only other seating options were two office-type chairs that would typically be around a table in the room, but are in front of the balcony door. The chairs are old, worn, and without any remaining cushioning. There is no table to sit at to have coffee or use a computer. The end tables by the bed are also worn. The large counter that the TV is on and the drawers support is much appreciated, but it is also worn. Probably because wet ponchos landed there and damaged the wood. \n\nWe don't appreciate paying resort fees. It's not a big resort fee, but junk fees are everywhere, and this is one of them. Just raise your prices by $11. That will make everyone think what a great price, and no resort fees. \n\nHousekeeping needs training. When we arrived, we did not have face cloths or a bathmat. The next housekeeper gave us all the towels we needed, but didn't replace the coffee. I am not sure how you get better quality control, and this seems to be a pervasive problem based on all our travels, but it is frustrating, nonetheless. \n\nThis may be a 7th floor issue, but there is a rumbling coming from the roof that eventually becomes white noise. At first, we thought it was the elevator, but if that was the case, rooms right next to the elevator would be horrible to have. Perhaps they are, I don't know. The rumbling is just weird.\n\nUltimately, we would consider the Quality Inn again, but knowing what we know about the 7th floor, we would request the 7th floor again to get the floors.

If Sheraton next door is not materially more expensive it should be the overwhelming choice instead of staying at CrownePlaza.  \n\nFirst the positives about CP.  At check-in I received an upgrade to a 2-bedroom suite as Diamond Ambassador guest which is more generous than what the vast majority of hotels would ever give, and it\u2019s not because I was staying in low season: we are in July with lots of tourists around.  The second strong point is the location of the hotel across the Rainbow bridge with superb views of the falls, pretty much the same as the views from Sheraton perhaps just a tiny bit better at Sheraton.  Service was very good not only at reception but also in the restaurant.  I am currently is pregnant and vomiting every morning but I need to eat nonetheless; my husband asked for takeaway boxes from the breakfast buffet so that we could have breakfast in the room which is not supposed to be allowed but they made an exception which was highly appreciated.  Given how spacious our suite was, the set-up was much better than being sick in a restaurant with several other guests around.  \n\nThe main negative was how dated the room was.  I have seen many dated hotels in my travels but this one is on a completely different level.  The fridge and the toilet must be at least 50 years old and the (low) ceilings also betray the age of the hotel which is very, very, very overdue for renovations.  Apparently Crowne Plaza decided that it\u2019s better to keep the hotel as is and get as much revenue as they can in the short term, but Sheraton took the opposite decision with their recent $50m renovation project.

When I booked a room with two double beds I didn't imagine the abomination that we would get. There was barely space between the furniture, a miniscule wardrobe just big enough to fit the ironing board and nowhere to store our luggage. As we were taking a long vacation, we have packed enough clothes to last 4 people 10 days, so there was a lot of it. All the luggage had to stay at the wall, plainly visible. The bathroom was infested with black mold (not good by any means, doubly so when you have a respiratory condition) and did not have a functioning fan. This last fact meant that 1) all the humidity would seep into the room and 2) the smells of the bodily functions would do the same. The AC was loud and completely inadequate to deal with either of them so we had to keep the window open. Housekeeping skipped our room 2 days out of the 5 (which meant no clean towels), but I can't really blame them - I figured they may not have been able to fit the cleaning trolley into that hole. There was no mini-fridge (forget about cold water) and no safe - again maybe not enough space.

If you like the big resort style vacation, this wouldn't be your cup of tea. But if you prefer a small boutique villa hotel with just 6 rooms, you can't do any better.  Beautiful rooms, unbeatable views, a glorious infinity pool, good food, and a very kind, personable, and attentive staff that can attend to whatever need you have.  There were only couples in the other rooms while we were there, all of whom were very quiet, respectful of each other, and sociable if engaged (no kids on premises!).  We chose not to sign up for a meal plan, as we wanted flexibility to have a filling late breakfast, skip lunch, and dine off premises a couple of the nights we were there. That worked well for us.  But we ended up dining off-site only one night, as the ambience, food, and service at Caille Blanc were so hard to pass up in their own right.  \n\nThe only suggestion I would make to management, would be to better clarify to guests just how much of the three service charges that appear on their invoice, is actually making its way into the pockets of their excellent staff.  For a 5 day stay, there were a total of $253.46 in three separate charges titled \""service charge\"", \""ancillary service charge\"", and \""staff hospitality gratuity\"" on my bill.  This was in addition to gratuities that, as I understood it, were already included in the pricing of the hotel's taxi service and excursions.  I am sure most would have no issue advancing 20% of the food\u002Fbeverage\u002Ftaxi\u002Fexcursion portion of their bill as gratuities for their excellent staff.  But it was unclear whether the three stated fees were actually going to the staff, or, if just some of it was going to staff and some going to the hotel. That left an uncomfortable uncertainty for me when I checked out as to whether the staff was in fact receiving a customary 20% gratuity on the food\u002Fbeverage\u002Ftaxis\u002Fexcursions portion of their bill.  \n\nWould we go again?

data/ca/147345/12805921/908606569.html,Caille Blanc Villa &amp; Hotel,"""Went from a Wednesday night-Sunday for a short celebration of my wife's 40th birthday.  We just were gaga over this Hotel.  There are only 5 rooms. \nWhen you arrive they will say \""Welcome to paradise\"" and they are right.  This was our first time in St. Lucia.  We stayed in the Grotto Suite and while we loved our private pool, most of the time we were at the resort we felt like it was our own private resort.  The team that waits on you are amazing, we remember all of your names, because you were all so genuinely lovely. St. Lucian's are a different kind of people; they truly know how to take care of you.  The airline did not load our luggage so we were a bit stressed on arrival.  They stopped at a minimart on the way and even had bug spray for us at the hotel.  Here are a few tips\u002Ftidbits that might be helpful:\n\n1. We did all inclusive so we didn't have to worry about not getting that drink or ordering a snack.  For all inclusive, make sure you just ask for the house vodka\u002Frum\u002Fbeer etc. It was a little confusing when we arrived and they asked if we wanted titos, belvedere, etc.  If you say yes, it's not like they upcharge you, you get charged an entire drink...$20 for a titos mixed drink!  Titos is not premium in the US, but it is in St. Lucia.  I'm sure I could have complained at the end and they would have removed it but we were so happy I didn't bother.  I'm just glad we asked or we would have rang up quite a bill.   The plantain chips for a snack were incredible, freshly made.  For breakfast they have a decent buffet.  But we just asked the chef to make us english muffins and eggs as well and they did no problem at all.  You can ask for the minibar to get stocked with whatever you'd like... 3-4 pitons, more rum, just ask.\n\n2. The road....lots written about the road. I'll add in my 2 cents.  Road from the airport to 10 minutes outside the hotel is no problem.   Once you get close to the hotel, your driver will basically stop and let you know it is off road for about 10 min and it is bumpy.   It isn't a dirt road.  It's a 40 year old paved road that has been patched here there and everywhere so many times.  It's not like you feel your life is in danger, there are no cliffs.  The drivers do it about 20 times a day and they are very careful and move very slowly so they don't damage their own vehicles and to provide a nice ride for you.  After taking the road once or twice it won't be a big deal. My wife is not adventurous; if she can do it, you can do it.\n\n3.  What to do on non-excursion days immediately around the hotel: Lounge, pool, eat drink.  I was disappointed there is no exercise room, but they are working on that apparently.  I like to do something active everyday.  There is an awesome beach Anse Chastanet about a 15 min walk down the bumpy Road (in the opposite direction you arrived from).  It is not suitable for running.  If you are a runner you will be disappointed here, but it is a great cardio workout coming back up the hill from the beach to the hotel!  At the hotel there is also a snorkel cove.  *You will need your own fins.  They have goggles and snorkel for sale ($30) but I would just bring your own if you can.  The treck down to the cove is not easy.....you have to be adventurous or like my wife you will turn around pretty quick.  In the photos they show 2 lounge chairs at the bottom with cocktail....that really made laugh there is no way you can carry a cocktail down that trail!  I did not snorkel there I had heard the snorkeling was better at Anse Chastanet beach so I didn't bother buying goggles.\n\n4. Beaches.  One of the couples went to most of the beaches in the area including sugar beach.  They said the best beach was Anse CHastanet and we couldn't agree more.   You can't screw up finding the beach.  You just keep walking until the road ends....there is the beach.  LOVE that it was in walking distance.  You can take a car if you want but walking is fun.  It's a little adventurous the first time but after that no big deal.  A small warning is the small stream in the road.  It is not fast moving and easy to get over, but deep enough that if you are wearing a sneaker it will get wet.   Bring some cash if you want to snorkel because they require a $50 cash deposit that is refunded after you return the gear.  But that deposit cannot be CC and there is no way you are going to walk back up that hill to your room.  After you beach for a bit walk to your right below the cliffs for about 5-10 min and you will come to another beautiful beach Anse Mamin. This is where you should have lunch.  Everyone raves about the Gourmet Burger.  It is a very very good burger.  Worth getting.\n\n5.  Bugs.  Bugs were not bad at all while we were there.  Most of the hotels have open room concepts where your only protection is a mosquito net.  All of the rooms at the Caille Blanc have doors you can slide shut at nightime to keep them out.  Sure, a few sneak by but no big deal.  Ask the staff to show you how the doors open close and latch.  It wasn't easy the first time, but again, we loved the views all day long and left them open.\n\nI wish I had time to write more details, but I don't.  Oh and try the sunset cruise.  You don't need it to be private.  Just ask the conceirge when you arrive it is $70 instead of like $500 for a private.  The suset cruise only had 3-4 couples who were all nice and we shared our trip with each other!  ",5,positive,"August 7, 2023",Anse Chastnet Road,"('Soufriere',)",,

There were a group of gentlemen there that struck up conversation with my boyfriend while I looked around. He mentioned it was my birthday and that we were looking for a good place to eat since most places were closed on Sunday. Turns out the chef to this place was there and he invited us over. Upon arrival we saw balloons tied to the chairs and birthday confetti tastefully scattered on the table. We received such a warm, genuine, energetic and friendly welcome. Jessy was our server, Arelious (might have misspelled his name) was the man who decorated our table, and Chef Andre made our meal. The food was incredible. We ordered the pumpkin coconut soup, tuna ceviche, stew, lion fish and chocolate mousse. The food was absolutely delicious but the stew was our least favorite. We also had very unique cocktails which were so delicious. Coconut mojito, tamarind twist and the deep temptation, or something like that. Super good! When they brought the dessert, they write \u201Chappy birthday\u201D with chocolate and added chocolate wafers to the plate while simultaneously playing the \u201Cit\u2019s a celebration\u201D song and the Caribbean \u201Chappy birthday\u201D song and even jamming to it. Overall they made the night so special and Jessy was ultra friendly, awesome person to talk to and very knowledgeable about the resort. Overall highly recommend this restaurant! Didn\u2019t stay here so can\u2019t speak on the resort itself but we did see the infinity pool and the surroundings and it does look beautiful. We are happy we were able to stumble across chef Andre on our final night in St Lucia for this amazing experience. \u2764\uFE0F",5,positive,"September 10, 2023",Anse Chastnet Road,"('Soufriere',)",,

Caille Blanc Villas has it all! \n\nMy husband and I stayed here for an anniversary trip and we didn't want to leave. Ernie, the General Manager, Hilarious, the Attendant & the entire staff were lovely greeting us by our family name, attending to our every need & helping to plan our time in St. Lucia.   \n\nThe property has the best views on the island. The famous Pitons are spectacular and can be seen from most villas, but the view from the infinity pool\u002Fdining area is the most enthralling! \n\nWe stayed in the Sunset Suit with a magnificent view from the shower room, has a wrap around patio & is situated by the pool.  \n\nDining around allowed us to see a few local propertiies, none of which had the stunning view that Caille Blanc has.  \n\nThank you to the entire staff for one of the greatest experiences we've had.

The staff went out of their way to make sure you had everything you needed and the food and drinks were top notch. Jesse is the best at making a custom cocktail based off of your taste. It\u2019s a close walk to the Anse Chastanet beach where you can scuba dive,snorkel, kayak, or hang out at the beach. There is no beach at Caille Blanc but the infinity pool overlooking the Pitons is the best view on the island! We went to Sugar beach, Anse Chastanet, and took a catamaran up the coast to Marigot Bay. None of those sites compare to the view from Caille Blanc. The Manet app is convenient to use for any request and booking excursions. Hilarius, Ernie, and Jesse were great!",5,positive,"December 19, 2023",Anse Chastnet Road,"('Soufriere',)",,

You cannot beat the grand reveal after an anticipatory drive up the narrow, rocky road to the villa. We spent 3 nights in the Upper Temple Suite, which was beautifully grand with it's private terrace, but also very comfortable. We were thoroughly impressed by the the kindness and attentiveness of the staff. The driver service was incredibly convenient and a life saver getting around Soufriere. We did not opt for the meal plan as we wanted to try other restaurants as well, but the daily breakfast was delicious as was the dinner we enjoyed at the villa on the night of our arrival. The rum punch made with local spices is highly recommend. \n\nEvery morning we woke up to a symphony of unique bird calls and the sun gently illuminating the Eastern face of Petit Piton. If you're looking for serenity, a calming and friendly place to stay when exploring the beauty of St. Lucia, Caille Blanc is the place to go!

Ernie the house manager was so helpful and everyone on the staff was very welcoming and friendly. The villa is filled with charm and character. We ventured down to the cove for some excellent snorkeling and enjoyed the botanical gardens. We loved resting in our room in the shade looking out at the Pitons. It often sprinkles in the afternoon creating the most spectacular rainbows over the sea.
